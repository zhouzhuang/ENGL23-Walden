This week’s reading took me back to my AP Literature class back in High School. This text, or I should say this first chapter, is full of ideas that can be apply to modern civilization. While the reading was certainly convoluted and sometimes hard to follow Thoreau’s train of thought, I certainly enjoyed it and found myself immersed. There were several quotes which I found to be interesting to me, and I will quote them as I write this. Thoreau argues that “most men… are so occupied with the actious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.” And that we have “no time to be anything but a machine.” He shows that humans pursue riches that are nothing but a fantasy. Instead of enjoying the things we have, and rightfully obtained with our own labor, we tend to compete with our “neighbors” to have better luxuries. Thoreau proposes to live a simple and practical life that is often “hindered” by all the noise that surround us all the time. However, in order to achieve the life described by Thoreau, we have to use self-criticism. We have to, or rather be willing to assess ourselves in a critical and honest manner. Only when we have identified the shortcomings of our lives, we are going to be able to live as simple as it can be. There’s have to be a balance between man and nature, and as of now, we are invading what is not ours. Humans are animals and as animals we have the choice to coexist with nature.  
<br><br>
At first, I couldn’t understand why Ken would assign such reading, but now I see why he did it. We can take Thoreau’s ideas and apply them to our own lives. One of them is that in order to be able to change our world, we have to objectively judge our lives. Yes, the climate change is an issue that affects the entire world, yet many are not doing anything to mitigate this problem. However, as Thoreau stated, “the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another man must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off.” What he is trying to communicate is that if we wait for others to have a change of hearts, then change will never come. We have to rectify ourselves to progressively change others. We “stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment.” We cannot continue blaming the previous generations for their selfishness and unresponsiveness. Nor can we hope for a future generation to fix the problems of our present. This is a turning point in human history, and we have the power to decide the lives of future generations. Failing to do anything with respect to climate change, will be catastrophic. He also touches on an important point: education. Society can teach us everything we need to know about the dangers of climate change, how to fix it, and what to do. However, what is knowledge without application? How can we possibly change the way we live if we don’t try the “experiment of living” as Thoreau describes? The educational system needs to change the way they teach their students and look for more proactive ways to engage them on the real issues of life. Lastly and above all, we need to tackle this issue as a population, yet we tend to put everyone against each other. Thoreau said,” The finest qualities of our nature like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.” Treating each other with respect would definitely yield the best future. Unfortunately, there are people in this world that prefer greediness and selfishness over the universal affairs of men.

At the beginning of the reading, I was just like you. Why would Ken make us read this long chapter? Does it even make sense? Even though he could have shortened the first chapter to a couple of paragraphs instead of rambling on but the more I read it, the more I understood the underlying reason why he assigned this reading. Although this reading was super confusing and long, Thoreau was basically saying humans really don’t require much to survive and live their life on earth and this could be tied back to climate change. Even though he could have shortened the first chapter to a couple of paragraphs instead of rambling on. As Ken said in one of his previous videos, in order to prevent climate change from constantly increasing, one thing that we can easily do is to produce less waste. If we change to a plant-based diet and live our lives as minimalist, we can easily reduce the CO2 emission, and just like what Thoreau is trying to do, he is just doing what he can to survive and not make any profit. To relate this back to modern society, a lot of oil companies are trying to profit from fracking and not realizing what this does to the climate. If they didn’t try to profit from the oil industry and only get the amount they need, climate change wouldn’t be as severe as it is today.

I like the part where Thoreau listed out the prices of building his house and how much he spends on food for eight months. I think this is a good touch because it allows people to see how much money it actually cost to survive without all the additional fees that they pay for a more luxurious lifestyle. It shows that in order to survive, it doesn’t cost that much but for all the other additional stuff people want, it causes a lot of damage to the earth and this is what people didn’t understand back then. Of course, people are thinking “he lived in 1845 where everything was super cheap and it barely cost anything to build a house in comparison to now” but if we were to think about it, nowadays, there are many alternatives than buying a house from the market. Buying a house in a market cost more because there are economic factors included now but if we really wanted to save earth from climate change, we could live in a place where we max its potential.

This chapter took me back to AP literature as well, perhaps with a better viewpoint and understanding after some years at UCSB. I'd agree that Thoreau's ideas of minimalist living and simplified lifestyles help satisfy our innate needs for happiness. It is interesting to think about what Thoreau would have to say about our seemingly exponentially lavish and material lifestyles. It seems that compared to Thoreau's time, we live in a completely different world, categorized by our need for "more". It is even more interesting to think about and question how this lifestyle approach is entirely opposite of our capitalist and dearly loved ideas of exponential growth and never ending consumerism. To apply these sentiments to your life would perhaps make you a "menace" to our consumer based economy. Thinking further into this, it seems that along with alluding to a changed lifestyle for the self, Thoreau is leaning towards a change of our social structure to one that supports this lifestyle. Just imagine how much could change if our economic sentiments were based on sustainability and minimalism.
<br><hr>
I enjoyed reading your take-aways from Thoreau’s points, analyzing how we should apply his messages to life in the 21st Century. I also think much of what Thoreau mentioned about his extreme minimalist life in Walden Woods can be taken as a metaphor, and we can take what he learned from his lifestyle and apply it to our modern lives. For example, Thoreau talked about the concept of warmth as a necessity to survival, yet “The luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot” (Ch. 1 of Walden). Let’s say one cotton jacket is the standard, that’s all an average person needs to stay “warm,” or comfortably survive in 50 degree Fahrenheit weather. But humans nowadays have other influences such as “trends” (stylish wool coats, animal fur, branded puffer jackets, scarves as accessories), home heaters, and even hand warmers, which are all “extra” to our basic necessities and keep us “unnaturally hot.” Humans definitely do not need to go out and buy new, “extra” items that make us “hot” in our daily lives, and in an ideal world, businesses also do not need to advertise to the public that these are necessities that we must buy, and should also operate on a business model different than selling unnecessary things to be successful and continue staying in business.
<br><br>

Another lesson Thoreau learned that made an impression on me was about work and productivity. He states, “For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my hands, and I found that, by working about six weeks in a year, I could meet all the expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well as most of my summers, I had free and clear for study” (Ch. 1 of Walden). I see this as very case-specific to Thoreau’s lifestyle in Walden, but the point here is, if we lived more and more with only basic necessities, we would have to work and earn less to live our lives. Complete opposite of American consumerist culture, thinking we need to work and earn more to afford those “extra” things in our life. I consider myself to be someone who strives to live unlike the American consumerist culture, and still, this aspect of Thoreau’s life opened my eyes and shifted my way of thinking even more. Imagine living your life in order to have more free time to pursue passions, travel, do the things that make you happy, instead of staying extra hours at work and earning “extra” money. I think people could benefit from lowering their standards of a comfortable life.

I agree with your comment, given that I was also confused at first but was able to read my way through. Towards the end of this chapter, Thoreau begins to get more and more philosophical. He uses a story about successful minimalism to spark a self-reflection from the reader. He not only uses a story of a simple lifestyle to prove that life must be as luxurious as some make it to be content and satisfied. One of the quotes that grabbed my attention states, “The rich are not simply kept comfortably warm; but unnaturally hot; they are cooked,”. Prior to this statement, Thoreau explained that the food we consume is the fuel that heats and powers our body, a simple and understandable concept. This statement can be interpreted in many ways,  one of which I understand to be that those who own grand amounts of items, whether it be big houses or a lot of clothing, are being ‘cooked’, or uncomfortable in terms of the real necessities in life. Uncomfortable in the sense that something does not feel right. This is not to say that they are unhappy, but they have too much that they do not need, they have a lot that they can go without and still be able to survive. In this context, being ‘rich’  can pertain to the many layers of clothing and size of shelter that some people have to keep themselves warm. It points at not simply literal clothing and homes but also all the materialistic items that we buy to make us feel good and successful. Another point that I took from Thoreau is the selfishness of institutions with power and their drive for wealth, as he states, “Economy is a subject which admits of being treated with levity, but it can never be disposed of,”. This statement caught my attention because it made me reflect on the US economy and the role it has played as one of the biggest economies in the world. This statement explains that as much as we sometimes hate how the economy works and how it drives the country, we can not get rid of it because it is essential to our country, it is what keeps money flowing. It can not be disposed of because we need an economy in order to live, in order to purchase our daily needs and to interact with one another. However, it should not get out of control, and at this point it has already gotten out of hand. Thoreau also writes, “Nations are possessed with an insane ambition to preserve the memory of themselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave”. This goes hand in hand with “Most of the stone a nation hammers goes toward its tomb only. It buries itself alive”. As you mention, if we do not start to act upon our acquired knowledge instead of focusing on what previous generations left us to deal with, we will only bury ourselves alive. We will continue to have a rich economy but at what costs? We will not only hurt those of the future but also those here today from poor countries that have no power to stop the unhealthy conditions of our planet. As I interpreted these statements, I understood that the US is just driven by money, that it will continue to harm and ignore the obvious issues as long as their are economic rewards. But this will only bring its collapse sooner and stronger. The US is so focused on remaining in power and being feared by inferior countries/economies without caring about the consequences that this will bring to everyone on the planet, including themselves.

Similar to you, I had trouble understanding Thoreau's rhetoric at the beginning of the chapter. However as I continued reading, I became aware of Thoreau's purpose for writing about such transformative ideas for his time. Thoreau reminded me of what society views at the modern day hippie. He was a minimalist who cared for people and the earth's well-being. His ideas were so revolutionary at a time when society was not nearly as close to the "rich" lifestyle we live today. What I liked about Thoreau, was that he is straight forward and laid out the necessities we need to live: food, shelter, water, clothing, fuel. He expands on each one of these ideas throughout the chapter. For example, he mentions how we only need food staples such as fruits, vegetables, and grains to survive. One of the quotes I resonated with from the chapter is "throwing the stones over their heads behind them and not seeing where they fell". I believe Thoreau was referencing a human's selfish behavior. Society is too willing to live a wealthy lifestyle and fails to see the repressions that come with it. 
<br><br>

I agree with many of Thoreau's views on living a minimalistic lifestyle. He stated that the "characteristic of wisdom is not to do desperate things". I believe this is true because a person must use their wisdom to figure out what they truly need and will understand that money does not buy happiness. When people are too consumed with having the most luxurious items, they tend to forget what is important and search for happiness in material items. I think a lot of Thoreau's concepts are being brought back to life in today's world and we should act upon them before it is too late.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment very much. After reading the first chapter of “Walden,” I understand what the author wants to share with the audience is that people shouldn’t focus on their properties too much. Just like the author mentions in his book, which you also mentioned, “he has no time to be anything but a machine.” By using this sentence, the author tries to warn the audience that people shouldn’t only aim at working for money. They ought to find the things they are interested in and create the meanings for their lives. People should focus on the improvement of their inner selves using the method of “self-criticism” as the author mentions in the book. Only by finding and correcting their weaknesses for that is the only way they can receive true happiness.
 <br><br>
     
Also, I agree with what Ken mentions in the lecture: by abandoning all the things except the daily necessities and living at the Walden Pond where there are a few people, Thoreau challenges the “scripted life.” At the period which Thoreau at, almost all the people lived in the noisy cities, enjoyed the pleasure which “Consumerism” brought them. However, Thoreau decided to be a loner, moved away from the cities for some time, and became a minimalist. This not only means he had to give up many subjects which he can have originally, but also he was under pressure for he was challenging the society and the public’s value. For the old generations, there already some people realized the fact that the climate is changing greatly due to human-caused pollutions. However, only a few of them were willing to change their living-style to save the environment, because they didn’t want to give up the goods they already had, or they didn’t want to be the “loner” as Thoreau.
    <br><br>
  
For our young generations, we should all learn from Thoreau to adapt to “minimalism” living style, for it can both save the environment and give true freedom to the individual.
<br><hr>
In reading the chapter, I found myself having many of the same thoughts that you stated in your comment regarding the reading. Many of the aspects of Thoreau's simplistic lifestyle were heavily dependent on how willing oneself is to disobey the conformations that society has built upon us. Your last statement hit a tone that has unfortunately been a staple of my life when it comes to putting aside differences in order to become better, and in a way kinder, overall as a society. Thoreau's challenging message requires reflection and respect that is hard to achieve in today's world of debate, doubt, and greed. The modern minimalist movement seen today takes many notes from Thoreau's ideas. However, it is unfortunate that it took over 150 years for it to truly come to fruition. In a way, many saw his ideas and immediately disregarded them in order to live a more lavish lifestyle. Take for example, clothing, which was addressed around a quarter into the chapter. He states, "We don garment after garment, as if we grew like exogenous plants by addition without." That aspect of human society has barely faltered, if anything it has grown even stronger as the fashion industry and fast fashion continue to be a staple part of the economy of the world. If the public didn't take into consideration the ideas of the past, how can we remain optimistic that the majority will now?
<br><hr>
I have always been bugged by our consumeristic society. So many people actively strive to achieve the “goal” of wealth, luxury, material goods, and extravagant services. However, wealth is not all that it is cracked up to be. 
     <br><br>

I feel as though humans have a (possibly natural) tendency to want to one-up one another. To have more, to live “better”, to experience the most that they possibly can. We constantly compare ourselves to someone else, in turn diminishing our accomplishments and unique attributes. Would it not be so much less painful and tedious to take pride in our own accomplishments, and to strengthen the lives of others through utilizing these qualities? Would it not be more effective to build on one another, to compound our similarities and fill-in for each other when something is missing? 
     <br><br>

When I was younger, and the news would come out with a report on the suicide of a well-known figure or “celebrity”, I used to wonder what could possibly be going wrong when you are cushioned by wealth. However, as time went on, and I experienced both the highs and lows of life, I realized that none of the good came from material items or consumerism. As the saying goes, “the good things in life are free”. While it is obviously not feasible to live life with absolutely no means of income, I truly believe that simplicity is key. I believe that--much like having low expectations can yield a more joyful outcome—having “less” in life leads to more overall happiness and contentment. If we do not set high expectations for our lives through material goods, we will be able to more thoroughly appreciate the cards that life does deal us, the simple pleasures that would otherwise go by as meaningless. As Thoreau says, “the luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot”.  
     <br><br>

Tying this back to climate change, I believe that we have somewhat screwed ourselves over by striving to live lavish lifestyles, and by passing on this idea generation after generation. Now that we are faced with the fact that if we don’t make drastic changes to the way we live we may not be alive at all, it is difficult for us to let go of these precedents. However, if we had never set them in the first place, this would not be an issue. We likely would not be in a climate crisis at all. 
     <br><br>

When Thoreau mentions that he was a reporter to a journal for a long time, with nothing returned for his labor but his pains, he says: “however, in this case my pains were their own reward”. This struck me deeply; I have always reflected on my past, and—despite there being a lot of challenges and traumas—I would not change it for the world. My pains shaped my personality, altered the way I view the world, and altered the way I interact with and treat each individual. While I am referring to my individual experiences alone, I know that I am not alone in experiencing these strange shifts. Many of the greatest people that I have known or met were shaped into the way that they are due to pain. This supports my belief that wealth, comfort, and luxury are not what we should strive to achieve in life; we should strive for collaboration, growth, and understanding. Those who have never faced challenges will not know how to handle them when they arise. When you constantly have something to fall back on, you will never face your difficulties head-on, and you will never learn from the experience of the challenge. 
     <br><br>

To summarize what I am essentially trying to say, I think that we would all benefit from simplicity. We would not only benefit ourselves in the present, but we would benefit the lives of future generations by passing on these lifestyle changes. “One generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels.” Like our generation can perhaps—and hopefully—abandon the consumeristic and materialistic ways of the generations before us.
<br><hr>
I strongly agree with your opinion. Consumerism is absolutely a huge block for our society to make improvements. As what you have mentioned, people always put their own profit in the first place. We think of ourselves first and it is true, human beings are selfish. Nevertheless, we should take our planet into consideration in order to make progress.
<br><hr>
Your comment is a very articulate digestion of Thoreau's work and I recognized that I made the same connections throughout reading this chapter. Pursuing "greater" things to mankind means chasing a more expensive, luxurious lifestyle. Centuries after Thoreau wrote Walden, our first-world society has not changed its values. It is definitely possible to live a "simple" life, only having the basic necessities needed to survive. However, somewhere between capitalism and consumerism, we have made it an expectation to exceed just the bare minimum. I, for example, know that I do not live a simple life as Thoreau describes. I live in an apartment with things that one does not need to survive, but may consider as luxuries, such as a television, couch, and even a coffee machine. If I did not have these things, I would probably still be alive and well. My life may be a little "dull" without my television to watch the Bachelor every Monday, but I'd still be fine. Thoreau outlines that he was able to survive with an extreme minimalist approach, however I am not sure if we would be able to do the same. It is ingrained in our lifestyle that we must pursue a lavish way of living to mark our success. Success in our generation is validated by how many figures are in our salary, how much our car is worth, and how many square feet our property encompasses. We have been trained to compare ourselves with who is "above" us in the hierarchy of success and to compete with them, in hopes of achieving happiness and satisfaction.

     <br><br>

The quote, "the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another man must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off” is an optimistic approach to changing our society. Often, we wait for others to do things first, and join in so that there is a consensus among society. In modern terms, this is what millennials and Generation-Z call bandwagoning. It is intimidating to be the first to start a movement, and of course much easier to do what everyone else does. This is one of the reasons why it took so long for us to make environmental changes, even though we were aware of global warming decades in advance. If mankind can initiate simplification of our lifestyle individually, minimalism can be achieved with no problem. However, it is in our nature to wait for others to do so first, which in turn delays our common goal. I hope that one day we can all take a step towards minimalism in unison to save our planet that we call home.

<br><hr>
I definitely agree that the text was especially immersive as I read about Thoreau's thoughts and ideas. The quotes you plucked out of the text were ones that also stuck out to me, particularly the line that compared humans to machines, “no time to be anything but a machine.” Thoreau was living in a period of great industrialization and technological advancements. His thoughts directly reflect his perspective on all the changes. It's interesting because much of his sentiments can be applied to modern civilization in that in today's day and age, technology has become far more advanced and continues to everyday. Our lifestyles have become mechanized, and daily tasks are machine operated. 
     <br><br>
There is a lot to learn and take from Thoreau's writing. Making changes to our consumerist lifestyles must start with reflecting on oneself and the impact we have. Every person has a carbon footprint, some less or more than others. The quote you analyzed, “the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another man must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off," has a very important lesson. The quote warns against waiting for others, and encourages beginning first, on your own means because waiting around for others will only delay progress. This generation is touted as the generation who is fighting climate change and change must be made. We cannot be idle and watch things get worst and come to regret the lack of action we took throughout our lives. Another generation will come after us, and we cannot let them inherit an Earth that is in a condition worse than the way it was handed to us. The anger we feel at the actions of the generation that preceded us will eventually be directed at us, as a generation who should've and could've made change, if we do not act now.

<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading your comment on the first chapter of "Walden" and your opinions on Thoreau's message because I feel that you condensed the bulk of his ideology while also elevating and embellishing it in your own way. Reading the first chapter was a bit confusing, but your comment helped to paint a clear picture of what Thoreau is saying about lifestyle choices, societal pressures, and the importance of changing ourselves to change the world. I especially loved the bit where you said "we have to objectively judge our lives" if we want to change the world. I think it is easy for a lot of people to look at the world and complain about all of the problems that occur each day, yet those same people are unwilling to give up luxuries such as big houses and an abundance of stuff in order to make the world a better place. It can be tough to accept that you may be part of the problem, but that is the first step in becoming part of the solution. The problem of climate change has already been identified, now is the time to make changes to our lifestyles and alter societal norms in a way that is beneficial to the environment and makes us happier. 
     <br><br>
I also agree with the point you made about the danger of waiting for our fellow humans to have a "change of hearts" and how that could delay the much needed initiation for change. Although it can be hard to start on the path of change alone, the time is now and there is no time to wait for people to decide whether or not climate change is an issue, because it is. We should not focus on the mistakes of the past or the possible destruction of the future, what is important is initiating change right here, right now.

<br><hr>
I heavily agree with the argument that we need to change ourselves before we can change our society, our world. One big thing that Thoreau discusses in the reading is when he said, "...the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot afford to sustain the manliest relations to men... He has no time to be anything but a machine". We are obviously so ingrained with the idea that need to work, to have things, to be "successful", that we have completely lost connection between each other and between us and the world we came from. Just like what you said, there HAS to be a balance between man and nature, because without that balance, we will not survive. Another quote that really stood out to me was when Thoreau talked about us "enslaving" ourselves, stating, "It is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself". With all the stuff we own, with how we commit our time and efforts to get all these luxuries, we are just slaving away our time for stuff that will make us unhappy and feel empty.

     <br><br>

I believe the only way out of this enslavement is by taking up Thoreau's proposal to change the way in which we live and be more connected with nature, especially if we want to help our environment. Even though Thoreau brought up these ideas in the past for a way to escape the noise and unhappiness of life, these ideas heavily apply for our success to save the world. And not just to save the place in which we live, to change our lives for the better. We need to change our selfishness, we need to respect our place in live, we need to respect our world. If this going to be a world effort to change our society, we need to change ourselves first. To change ourselves, we need to step out of the scripted lives given to us, just like how Ken and Thoreau said, and create a new livelihood for us to be in and live in a truly prosperous lifestyle.


<br><hr>
As everyone is catching the reason why ken made us read this chapter I think this is great to combine all the readings, films and lectures we have read and watched so far.  The idea of starting change by yourself and not waiting for others connects to when we were talking about many people becoming vegan.  A lot of people did not do it at first but now a lot of people are considering or are living a vegan lifestyle.  In the past, it was hard for people to make the change but now today, it is easier because so many people do it.  This connects to the Thoreau ideal of one must start their journey to change by themselves or else they have to wait for others to start their first because one person had to make that change earlier than everyone else when it was not so easy.  
     <br><br>


I also agree with the other replies where this generation cannot wait for Ken's generation to make a change for the climate because they caused it.  This generation needs to make change happen by ourselves other than waiting for his generation to cause change.  I know this generation is doing a lot of help fight against climate change due to the lack of effort from the last generation.
<br><hr>

I find the quote that people have “no time to be anything but a machine” interesting too. I remember reading a short story in high school that described how human actions could be hindered by a simple change in the direction of the wind. Such a change in a small parameter breaks the machines that are humans, programmed to continue through life monotonously. Though fictional, it really exemplifies how humans are creatures of habit, and are not comfortable with change. This can be seen in today’s inertia towards combatting climate change. Outside of the more extreme climate activists, most people, including, I believe, many of us in the class, have not made too large of steps to change our habits for the better. Many people still eat meat, drive cars, and own large houses. It is inherently difficult to make changes and simplify.
     <br><br>
I enjoyed reading the part of your comment about education. It can definitely play a large role in pushing against climate change, as well as many other issues. Proper education is essential in catalyzing change, as exposing the younger generation to the facts and solutions of our current problems can inspire change.
     <br><br>
However, in the end, it really does depend on each individual’s ability to make their own change. We cannot wait for others the make that change for us. If we do, nothing will happen, as according to Newton’s first law of physics, and object at rest will stay at rest unless acted upon by an outside force. If we do not accept this outside force pushing us to combat climate change, nothing will change.
<br><hr>
I have not read Thoreau’s Walden before, but I have heard discussion and read analysis about in, said and written from many different perspective: some from philosophical aspect, some from literary aspect, some from political aspect. I didn’t expect it to be a reading assignment for a course teaching climate crisis. However, after watching the video introducing the solutions of climate crisis should be targeting at the culture instead of merely technology, I started to understand that a minimalistic lifestyle is essential to reduce the carbon emission and thus helping our planet. To be honest, I did not enjoy reading the book like you did. The language and the flow of Thoreau’s idea were hard to follow. But I sincerely respect his mindset and his epiphany because he demonstrates the exact dilemma for the future people as early as in the nineteenth century. 

     <br><br>

It is impossible in this modern age for every human being to get the chance of living individually in the wilderness, making a self-sufficient life by growing their own food and building their own shelter. Even if it is, few of us have the capability of refusing all the fancy advertisements and marketing strategies tailored to attract people to consume more and more. Sometimes I think about my life too. Is it getting more complicated overall? Does watching shopping hauls and cosmetics unboxing on YouTube make me happier? Does participating in the fast fashion industry make me happier? I might answer yes for now, but looking at my lifestyle from a bigger picture, I keep wanting more. Just as my consumption continues to rise, my vanity and greed continues to rise. Thoreau writes in the first chapter, “As if one were to wear any sort of coat which the tailor might cut out for him... complain of hard times because he could not afford to buy him a crown! It is possible to invent a house still more convenient and luxurious than we have, which yet all would admit that man could not afford to pay for. Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not sometimes to be content with less?” The more we consume, the more we are trapped in this endless cycle of wanting more but not being able to due to the scarcity of resources. But when we keep our life as simple as possible, we will avoid the overwhelming desire and sadness.
     <br><br>


Maybe the ultimate and ideal solution to the climate crisis is to make every human being enthusiastic about living a simple life and be content— at least more content than now— for what they already possessed. It is interesting to think that climate crisis, which seems like a physical science, will fall on a discussion of a rather philosophical principle— minimalism.
<br><hr>

I also agree with you that we should unite together as a community to tackle the climate crisis rather than blaming past generations or expecting future generations. In Walden, Thoreau provokes a whole new ideology of lifestyle—minimalism, in which that the things we need are“food, shelter, clothing, and fuel.” He brings up a different opinion of the way we should live instead of chasing those luxuries that may, in return, causing tons of burden and pressure. Living in a small cabin with the least amount of things is his success in simplifying his life and also finding his happiness. He records his life in a journal and provides his findings through the observance of nature. Besides, self-reliance is the central theme of Walden, which he was able to survive on little things and money and was able to enhance his spiritual values. 

     <br><br>

Education and responsiveness are essential aspects of the climate crisis. The knowledge we gain from school or any information we get from the media should be well-organized and well-phrased. The issue is that we should recognize the intrinsic value rather than economic value, and the materialism and consuming world we have today complicate the process of being environmentally friendly. Besides, I agree with you that many people are greedy, which they see money, power, and social status over everyone else life.
<br><hr>
I completely agree, it also made me think of the AP Literature in high school. When I first saw it was assigned I also wondered why Ken would have as read the first chapter. Although the text can be hard to follow and seems quite long, the takeaways that are being presented relates to how we should be thinking about climate change and it became clear why he had us read it.
     <br><br>

I really liked it when you mentioned that if we sit back and wait for people to change then it simply will never happen. What it seems that people have done is wait for something to happen or for someone to initiate a movement or change. If we as individuals don’t come together and agree the planet is in fact changing and can lead to catastrophic events, future generations will suffer. We have physical evidence happening all around us from fires to floods. We should stop putting the blame on older generations and start to take action. 
     <br><br>

The message of simplicity also reminds me of what I learned in ENVS 2. We talked a lot about how living a minimalist lifestyle could help our environment. We read the book, “The Story of Stuff” by Annie Leonard and it was able to display how much production goes into the products we own and the harmful effects they have on our environment. So many people go above and beyond in order to have luxury items. People exceed the amount of necessities we need for survival and continue to buy and force more production. It will be a lot harder for some people to change their lifestyle but it's not impossible.

<br><hr>

I can completely understand what you thought when you start to read the chapter. When I first read through several paragraph, I am confused about this kind of lifestyle. It’s just extremely different from what I, or most of people, am living right now. However, I start to understand the author after I finished reading this chapter. The life he is been emphasized about is simplified. While I was having another course, I also read some articles that tells technology is substituting for nature, and we should stop this trend. That author also advocates us to live natural, but more extreme than Thoreau’s claims. He suggests human to live in a cabin without any modern technology like phones or internet, even without running water. When read that article I thought that it was crazy, how can we live with that kind of lifestyle. But now after I read Thoreau’s article, I found out that this lifestyle he proclaims is more acceptable and more applicable, and we can do it right now.

<br><hr>
I took AP Literature as well and agree that this week's article had a strong relation. Thoreau's writing style is a little more complex and at times difficult to understand. He writes with advanced terminology and has many meaningful quotes within his text. I like how Thoreau tries to connect humans with nature and talks about the finer things in life that make us happy. He takes a somewhat philosophical approach to his writing that gives off calm and tranquil vibes. He explores the subject of living simple and minimalist lives. He says that some do not need as much as others to survive and thrive in society, whereas more people in today's society are always wanting more. Thoreau then relates the subject to the climate crisis and touches on how education plays a role. At the end of the day, we need to live our best lives and put our best foot forward to maintain our Earth. We need to clear our minds and enjoy the important things and not always worry about materialism as well. We need everyone with similar mindsets to band together so we can start to make differences to improve the climate crisis going forward. Even simple things like reducing waste and minimizing use of certain resources is an easy start to fixing the bigger problem. Sooner or later people will see how urgent of a problem this is and that we need to act now.

<br><hr>
I agree with you on both counts. The reading was definitely convoluted and it was often difficult to pinpoint what Thoreau’s main point was but he wrote a lot of things in this first chapter that are actually applicable to our lives in the 21st century, particularly with regards to the benefits of a minimalist approach to life. 

     <br><br>

I also agree with your interpretation of Thoreau’s “the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another man must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off.” When addressing any issue, big or small, it is important to start with ourselves before tackling change on a larger scale. After all, we can only be real advocates for real change if we practice what we preach. 

     <br><br>

Conversely, there was a particularly passage in the text that really stood out to me: “What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be a falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What old people say you cannot do, you try and find that you can. Old deeds for old people, and new deeds for new… Age is no better, hardly so well qualified for an instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost.” 
     <br><br>

I think the above passage is entirely applicable to the situation surrounding the climate crisis. The previous generation is mostly responsible for the problem but as Thoreau states, we should not follow their example and allow ourselves to become complacent and propagate the problem. Otherwise, the next generation will hold us equally, if not more responsible for the irreversible damage done to the planet.


<br><hr>

I completely agree with the notion that right now is a turning point in human history. There is no point in blaming the destructive generations of the past and this crisis must not be delayed for future generations. With this being the case, our impact on the environment is still increasing and this trend is not slowing down without radical intervention. Rather than waiting for such radical intervention to take place in the form of activism or major policy change, it may be more fruitful to start changing as an individual. This goes back to your point on how if everyone is waiting for everyone to change, nothing ever will. However, if people are willing to realize those change independently, then global changes have a chance of becoming implemented. If we waited for other to change their minds, then sitting idle and being complacent becomes a major danger. 

     <br><br>

While it was difficult to how this reading had to do with climate change in the beginning, I realized that profound changes could be made if some of the ideal discussed in the reading became implemented in the lives of modern-day consumers. If we choose to live off the environment in a harmonious way, there could be great mutual benefits to be gained. If people adopted a more minimalistic lifestyle that Thoreau advocates, the foundations of a more harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship between humans and nature can be established.
<br><hr>
I also couldn't really understand how this chapter could relate to the course content, however, I see what the underlying theme is. We should all take a thorough look at our individual lives to see what can be cut out in order to place more importance on the things we actually need. If we are going to make meaningful change globally, we must start with our own lives and go from there. It made me think back to watching the film about Minimalism in English 22, where our society places this huge focus on what would make our lives more comfortable. These things are nice to have of course, but they aren't necessary for survival and take away from important things like food and housing security. I found it interesting that he compared college back then versus how we all understand about it now. It shows how the education system places a huge focus on amenities that are arguably easier to reach, leaving us without the resources to cover necessities like rent, food and especially tuition. 
     <br><br>


I really enjoyed your viewpoint about how important education and applying the knowledge to real life. In my experience, quite a few of my classes have centered their focus on learning the material solely for the class grade without much feasibility of retaining that knowledge after college. I think that learning about important aspects of society is just as necessary as the education that we receive in higher institutions. What is missing is that connection between the two, and when one is able to go back and forth between these two mediums, that is what will help push us to work together rather than blame each other without regarding our own lifestyle choices.
<br><hr>



I would agree with your opinion. Even as early as the 1850, Thoreau felt the unnecessary luxury of keeping objects that you don’t actually need is a burden. It’s a burden that is infiltrated by others, mainly comerciales and social media, and then we subconsciously carried the burdens on to prop up a frail ego. For years and years, I’ve been burdened by the question of what it is to be successful. It is being rich, or is it being recognized. When I’m picturing some successful figures, items like champagne and tuxedo came into my mind. It is weird because extremely wealthy figures like Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg always appears in very simple clothings. It is indeed the ability to make a difference in the world, the desire to be friendly to people and the environment and the feeling of being trusted by our loved ones that truly makes us happy. Today i would say the reason why minimalists could live a humble but satisfying life is the same as Thoreau’s reason to chose to live by the Walden—— that success is not achieved by consuming fancy stuffs, but by listening to the demand of your own heart.


<br><hr>
While it took me back to AP Lang, that did not last for long. I remember getting caught up in Thoreau's rhetorical device too much to take in the majority of the material then. However, reading it this time, I looked for meaning and Thoreau's intentions, rather than just finding examples of transcendentalist rhetoric, and I am glad I did; not only did I find instructions on why living a minimalist lifestyle is good, but I also found critiques of society that have become even more accurate in the time following this work.
      <br><br>

Thoreau discusses in detail how we have come to assign extra and unnecessary values to items, and in doing so have increased our consumption of them and dependence on them. With clothes, he astutely gives the example of how their primary function is to keep us warm, and yet society imbues far more meaning into clothes, especially with the emergence of fast fashion industries and the popularization of specific clothing styles or brands. While two shirts may have the exact same utility and maybe even the same material, they can differ dramatically in price and how they are perceived; Kanye West sold a blank white t-shirts for $120 and they immediately sold out. For that price, you can feed a family of four for two weeks with relative ease. The shirt? you can buy one at a thrift store for less than two dollars. It will fit the same way, it will look the same way, serve the same function, and cost you 1/60th of the price. This lavish spending on "luxurious" items is a core issue with consumerism in the 21st century and it has to stop. While the glamor of a cheaper shirt is not as much, that should not matter. The appeal of a sports car that costs a quarter million dollars is not worth the price, especially when the person buying it lives in a city, and can just as easily ride a bike or use public transportation.
      <br><br>

The same is true of houses. Owning a 10 million dollar mansion in Beverly Hills serves the same purpose as owning a cabin in the woods. Granted, the former gives one social connectedness and running water, but even those, while convenient luxuries, are not necessary to live life. Living lives of excess is a plague, a plague that has infected nearly every person in the world. The reality is, most people who do not have a mansion aspire to have the kind of money where they can own one. It is as if, only through entering the top X% of wealth gives people happiness, but material goods have no inherent value beyond providing the means for survival. Happiness comes from how one lives their life, not from what one lives it with. 
     <br><br>


Thoreau gives a plethora of other examples, like how Walden provides a perfect place for business. It is implied here that Walden is a perfect place for conducting the business of living, not a business of the unnecessary sort, and the business of life is all that matters.

<br><hr>

While I agree that implementing Thoreau's ideas into our own lives would be a good idea that could help to mitigate the climate crisis, it is not plausible for many people. Living a minimalist lifestyle requires some financial stability because the few materialistic possessions minimalists own are of high quality so that they can last. Many Americans who are living paycheck to paycheck do not have this opportunity. So while this may be a solution for some, we cannot expect everyone to be able to participate in a minimalist lifestyle until the wealth disparity is addressed.

<br><hr>

In all honesty, while reading this chapter by Thoreau, initially I found it quite difficult to comprehend some points he was making. Although, as I continued to read, it became quite evident as to what he was trying to prove. Which I can agree with you, it kind of brings me back to high school when I took AP Literature. Comparing how he lived to how most of us live today has a major, apparent difference. It is evident throughout the reading how sustainable and minimal living is the main topic. Throughout Walden, many points were made that really caught my eye about the things many of us often purchase due to wants instead of needs was including in this reading when Thoreau explains that the "grand necessity [...] for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the vital heat in us." Thoreau compares the differences between vital warmth that is needed versus warmth from things we want, better known as luxuries. He states: "When a man is warmed by the several modes [...] what does he want next?" I believe this is the sad truth, many individuals nowadays find temporary warmth in luxury; although, Ken provided in the previous lecture that overspending is a factor towards the climate crisis we experience in our daily lives. With both Thoreau and Ken tying luxury and climate crisis together, should really open those individuals that believe in the warmth from luxury and clout. Although it is nice to have nice things, many of us do not realize that we tend to forget about those luxuries later on. Throughout the reading, I just kept thinking to myself that "less is more."

<br><hr>
I strongly agree with your point about the need for human to find the balance between man and nature, as that way our world can be sustained and so does human well-being. Seeing a lot of news reported daily, we can see how people do things regardless of their impacts on the environment solely for more profits and interests that can be enjoyed by human beings. However, that happiness and enjoyments are not going to sustain and last in the long term, because human life is based on the environment and nature, so if we destroy the nature, what kind of good life can human life embrace?
     <br><br>

I also found Thoreau's depiction of a serene and simplistic life intriguing, as that way of life really emphasizes more on the spiritual wealth and experiences rather than material wealth and abundance of stuff. Even though I admittedly see that it's barely practical to live that kind of life in reality nowadays, I see the underlying belief or spirituality of that lifestyle instructive to our modern life, especially on aspects such as rational consumer behaviors, housing choices, and eating habits. The features of the lifestyle depicted by Thoreau are closely compatible with the film we just watched about minimalism, and both showed some intrinsic benefits and beauty of a simplistic life. I also found Thoreau's idea about start acting now rather than waiting until fully prepared encouraging, which was also pointed out by Octavio. I admit the importance of learning and preparation for an action, but I also think that at least we can learn and empower us with stronger ability to make a change while acting and literally making the change, which can make the progress of change observable and long-lasting since the earliest time possible, which is now.
     <br><br>

Besides the two points above that I strongly agree with Octavio, I also found some other things in this book that are interesting or instructive. For example, when Thoreau talks about philanthropy, he says that "it is greatly overrated; and it is our selfishness that overrates it", which I think is a thoughtful reflection on philanthropy, as that is often regarded as a very good thing, but the simplest "giving" way of philanthropy is probably not the best solution. This reflection may help to develop some effective solutions to certain social problems such as wealth inequality and homelessness that can also be pertinent to our societal harmony and question about resource allocation.
<br><hr>
I really enjoyed this comment’s take on and analysis of the chapter of Walden. The focus on the personal responsibilities outlined by Thoreau were especially moving for me.  Society changes one person at a time and if someone like Thoreau could influence so many with his story then practicing and sharing his philosophy with others would be a great way for us to continue his legacy.  I also appreciated your note on how this idea ties into the idea of taking initiative and moving on from placing blame on past generations and focusing on what we can do for the future. I also liked the quote that you chose about how humans are like machines when living in this consumer culture.  The fact that Thoreau recognized this so long ago is frankly scary to me.  I feel as though he would be baffled and ashamed of America in this age and I think we should be too. Finally, the comment about treating one another delicately in order to nourish ourselves and others spoke to the philosophy that Thoreau shared.  One thing I enjoyed this week with both Walden and Minimalism is that the benefits outlined in both extended far past the positive impact that our actions will have on the climate and touched on the positive impact that doing these things will have on our souls and the souls of those around us. This to me seems like a no brainer win-win situation.
<br><hr>
While reading the first chapter, I was also struck by Walden's argument of society's pursuit of happiness and riches, when in actuality it results in nothing. I feel as though modern day society has fallen ever more deeply into the cycle of insatiable desire for more and for better. This sadly has become the norm of commonly held goals and proud accomplishments, living a "comfortable" lifestyle even though it actually is a lifestyle of utmost convenience and luxury. People are consistently and increasingly having this be the standard of "making it" in life. As a result, there is an ignorance in the lavishness and excess it all ensues. I feel as though Thoreau's ideas demonstrate and highlight the beauty in simplicity and minimalism. There is no need for the latest technologies, large homes, or designer fashion. Inherently, human civilization started on this planet in the most basic nature where the greatest purpose in life was to be healthy and survive. This lack of material things that we have now does not mean that the sense of fulfillment of generations before us was any less or does it dictate how "happy" one is. I feel the reason for this is because that is all they had ever known. We have become greedy and immersed in a way of life that is showered in having bigger and better. Due to this sad reality, the satisfaction of life has not increased or improved. We just have our standards too high at the expense of a dying planet. I feel as though there is great change that must take place now before it is too late as we continue along this continuous cycle of materialism and consumerism.
<br><hr>
I suppose that Thoreau himself also mentions how he “[has] yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors”. Although I do find this statement a bit harsh on the older generations, but as you said, what he is implying is that education from our teachers, professors alone will not be sufficient, we ourselves must try, “experiment” on new things if we want to bring about some changes.
       <br><br>
 “Old deeds for old people”. Many generations prior really didn’t know enough (or act enough) about climate change, as it is very easy to just follow the steps our ancestors took. The older generations embraced the American Dream, the materialistic lifestyle, the consumer culture, and many people today still perceive these as the only demonstration of success. Walden shows us that success doesn’t have to be a luxurious life. As part of the new generation, we need to realize that the lifestyle that our parents and grandparents have (or wish to have) might not be the lifestyle that is worth having, and teach the next generation that our lifestyle can be even further improved.

<br><hr>

as you said, this is the turning point in human history, and I completely agree with you. Our generation has to be the one who leads the future generations into a better and safer future. However, taking into consideration how easy it would have been for Thoreau's generation to change their lifestyles and how so many people were still not willing to change, it makes me a little disappointed about our current situation. I imagine it will be so hard to alter the way of living of not even the entire world, but just several countries who contribute the most to the problem of climate change at this point. And I am actually clueless about what we have to do now to spread awareness about this issue and make more people care.  
       <br><br>
To answer Ken's question, I think Thoreau's life near the Walden pond was more of an experiment from his side rather than a way of life that should be followed by everyone. I think it will be pretty hard for a modern human to just transform into an environmentally friendly person since almost everything we do releases carbon into the atmosphere. But there is always hope for the best, and I think that in the most dangerous and risky situations people will come together and act towards saving the most important problem.
<br><hr>
I agree with you that this reading reminded me of my high school Literature class. I remember reading "Into the Wild," which Ken mentions in the video, in high school and discussing the merits of living a minimalist life. However, unlike that book, "Walden" more directly addresses a lot of the issues that are present in society. As you said, Thoreau's ideas can be taken and applied to our own lives today. I was astounded by how many of the themes he muses on are even more relevant in today's society. The drive to have material possessions just leads to competition with neighbors and leaves no one feeling satisfied. There are a lot of behaviors that need to be changed if we want to effectively combat the climate crisis, and Thoreau is also right in that you can not simply wait for those around to change as that can take a long time. Instead, we must be willing to act now to try to fix our problems quickly. 

       <br><br>

Something that discouraged me while reading this book is that these ideas have been present for so long, and yet have never been carried out. Thoreau advocated for minimalism and a return to a strong relationship with nature, yet his advice was not heeded and people continued to destroy the planet's resources for the goal of material goods. It makes me wonder what it will take to truly change the way the people in this country live their lives in a way that benefits the planet.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you said about us starting to change without waiting for others. Once we have changed, we might even be able to use that as a blueprint for others to do the same. The topic that came up in Thoreau's writing that seemed to me to be a reoccurring theme was that we often look for happiness and fulfillment in the wrong places. Consumerism and our power-driven society have led much of humanity to believe that it can be found in material wealth or fame, but Thoreau argues that none of these wants will bring us what we need. He argues a point that by appreciating what we already have and through connecting back to the natural world, we will be happier and live more wholesome lives. This approach of connecting back to nature can be reflected in much of the work being done in eco psychology and environmental ethics today. While some still look to technology and innovation to solve our problems, this alternate approach argues that we will only find further suffering and discomfort through these endeavors. We have alienated ourselves from the natural world and henceforth, many people today often find themselves lost. I really enjoyed reading Thoreau's writing because it reflected many of the ideas I have been looking into recently of changing the way we view our needs and desires to be more ecocentric and based in living in harmony with nature. If we spark this change of perspective within ourselves, we can then lead others or teach others to do the same.

<br><hr>
I agree! There were several instances where I found myself rereading the same sentence over and over again because of how confusing the text was at certain points. At first, I didn't really like the reading per se but the more I continued, the more I found myself becoming intrigued with what Thoreau had to say on minimalism. He emphasizes the idea of getting rid of materialistic items and rather switching to a lifestyle of few objects and simplicity. Over the years, the idea of living a luxurious lifestyle and flaunting your wealth with expensive cars and clothing has become more and more normalized and accepted. The human population has become greedy and unappreciative of what they have, considering how the average American home has increased in size by over 1000 feet since 1973. Living a minimalist lifestyle would not only make you happier since you'd have less stuff to worry about, but would then lead to your contribution towards stabilizing climate change rates. Reusing old furniture or clothing would be one less product production companies would have to make, thus leading to a little less of CO2 emissions in the air.

<br><hr>
Although I have read works written by Henry David Thoreau before also through AP Literature back in high school, I did not have the opportunity to read his 1854 classic Walden before this class. I agree that he is full of ideas that can be applied to modern civilization as he referenced a life similar to the concept of minimalism when he wrote that “he see[s] young men, [his] townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of.” I also did not understand why Ken made us read this chapter in the beginning, but I soon realized how relevant it was to this week’s topics of cutting back on unnecessary consumption of goods. In addition, I really appreciate your analysis on the quotes “the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another man must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off” and how we “stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment” because it also made me realize that this reading also ties back to the points the Ken made in his previous lectures. It is interesting to see that the ideas from over a hundred years ago can solutions to the situations we have today despite the different environment of the people back then compared to today’s society, including all of the current technological advancements. However, it also shows that most people are still not incorporating the minimalist ideas into their daily life even after over a hundred years despite its benefits, and this is simply because of people’s own greed.

<br><hr>
I was also a bit confused about why the first chapter was relevant to our class. I slowly began to realize that Thoreau's ideas represented ideas of simplicity and minimalism, which are reflected in the climate activist movement.  I like that you stressed taking responsibility for ourselves instead of waiting for the people around us to take action, and then following them. I wholeheartedly agree with that idea. If we do not want to take the initiative and change our lifestyle, what's to say somebody else will? I think that as a culture, we need to stop living by the "monkey see - monkey do" philosophy that was referenced in the reading. People need to think for themselves, and in turn do what they believe they should do, rather than waiting to see what other people will do, or what celebrities will do and then just following suit. I also hate the attitude that many people have about their impact on the environment. I know plenty of people who believe in the climate crisis, but do absolutely nothing about it because they do not think that differences in their lifestyle will make a difference. They think that since everyone else has a giant carbon footprint, making their own smaller will be useless. I believe this is the attitude that many in our society have, and it is one that we need to get rid of.
<br><hr>
I agree with most of these replies and your original statement, I wasn't sure why exactly we had to read this. The chapter had, in short, an enormous amount of information that was relevant to us. The reading was very dense but if you took breaks and took the time to really try and understand it, that's when you see the value behind it. Thoreau covered many topics concerning the economy, how humans should live life, minimalism, sustainability, nature, etc. All of which are relevant to this course material. Thoreau drastically changed his lifestyle and showed his readers not much about HIM really changed. At the very least, Thoreau can teach each and every one of us to live simpler lives and change the way we think about our relationship with the earth. Personally, the message "less can mean more" kept on ringing in my mind. I personally love fashion and constantly look for drops from big companies like Supreme, BAPE, etc. Lately I haven't really seemed to care, I have many clothes in my closet but I always tend to wear the older ones that fit me well and the ones I like. In short, im trying to say I don't need all of what I have. Over winter break I donated a generous amount out of my personal closet and in all honesty I felt good about it. I had anxiety before the fact thinking that I might wear that shirt or I might need these jeans but the moment I gave them away, I felt relieved. Thoreau lived a drastically simpler life than any of us have during those two years he lived in that cabin. He reduced his CO2 emissions tremendously, kept a rather "successful" life, and had the bare minimum in regards to materialistic value. He consistently reminded his reader how cheap, effortless, and easy it was to live simple. He taught a great lesson to his readers back then, and an even greater lesson to us today.

<br><hr>
I think the most important part of your comment is when you quote Thoreau saying, “the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another man must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off.” This was the most important quote to me in the reading as it stuck out to me as an example of why I myself have not always made my changes. I know what I can do, yet I often never make any attempt to change because "just one person won't make any difference." I think to myself why should I stop doing things I enjoy if it won't have a difference on the world. However, after reading this, I think I will start taking my actions. Even though I still believe they won't have a difference on the world alone, they may have a difference on my life and how I perceive life as they did on the narrator in Walden. 
       <br><br>
This quote also ties in on my stance on government policy on climate change. I want a Green New Deal, because it forces us to make change as a group, and nobody can linger behind. This way, everyone starts working today and a real change can be made instead of just changing one by one and people not wanting to change without their peers.
       <br><br>
Also, in connection with us living out our roles in life as if we are characters in a play, I think that by being able to make changes for ourselves without worrying about our friends or peers not making the same changes is essential to living a valuable life.

<br><hr>
I appreciate your comment that has made me realized about Walden's book and his ideas. It makes me really reflect back to my life when I first time saw his lifestyle through the syllabus. Am I living too luxuriously while having no consciousness about it? After reading through the chapter I finally told myself that I am right and wrong at the same time. I am right with the answer, and I am wrong with the whole lifestyle. Do we really need a car? The rush and the laziness in human instincts forced the technology to bring everyone a car. However, it never makes the Earth feel convenient. So that did not make it possible for us, the animal, to "coexist with the mother nature." I think I was moved and influenced that I, in the future, will not only keep the academy but also keep the world healthy.

I also was taken back to my high school AP Lit class by this week's reading. It's interesting to me to see how differently my perspective has changed since then regarding Thoreau's "Walden." Back then I wasn't very aware of the climate crisis like I am now, and so during my AP class obviously we went over this reading and discussed Thoreau's view on nature and materialism, however I didn't make the same connections between the ideas Thoreau promoted and the climate crisis as I do now that I have been at UCSB. I agree that Thoreau can be quite hard to follow, but it is well worth the read, and for me the re-reading. When I reread it I was able to see why Ken assigned this reading, because Thoreau speaks upon the idea of minimalism and only surviving off of what you absolutely require to live. For Thoreau, this wasn't a lifestyle, it was an experiment, however, this experiment on its own was able to provide Thoreau with so much insight on his life and the world around him. I feel that him sharing his ways was controversial back in his time, but now we see him as a revolutionary. Making the connection between Thoreau's experiment and addressing the climate crisis is very important because Thoreau provides us with a series of solutions to the problem. Overall I think what we need to take from Thoreau is the idea of becoming less consumeristic and more minimalistic in an effort to produce less waste and use less overall.
<br><hr>
Your comments express my feelings too. It’s absolutely true that Walden has a great idea and tries to influence everyone by doing it. Especially the readers who like him, they try to “make his dream comes true” realistically.
       <br><br>

However, minimalism of “our grandparents’” is quite different from those which of the modern world that we are currently in. People are living too well during their whole life and realize that they actually “deserve it” in this modern world, which means they wouldn’t accept minimalism and would think that it is social status related. For instance, the proposal of recycling, the proposal of against fashion industry, and the proposal of against imported food, are all too difficult for modern people to practice, since they are all related too much with various aspects of people’s life.
       <br><br>

In conclusion, Walden’s idea doesn’t necessarily mean that people have to do exactly the same thing, but to have an attitudinal change on how people should save the resources and protect the environment.

<br><hr>

I have the same feeling with you that it’s a hard process to understand his metaphors while he uses a great number of Greek mythologies. I was also doubt why Ken asked us to such a literature work at first. 
       <br><br>
At this point, I understand his care and thought. After reading the whole chapter, I was not only surprised that a man can spend so less money in 2 years, but also impressed by his consistency and determination of protecting the environment. As he compared England to old gentleman with lots of luggage, he criticized people’s living way of maintaining too much gaudy things. In his book, he proposed a new way of living by which only keep those that are essential for survival and people should be self-sufficient by growing crops and building house by themselves. 
       <br><br>
Echo with this week’s film, minimalism can prevent further climate crisis indeed. Though we don’t need to live besides wake like Thoreau, we can be as minimalist as we can be. For example, we can stop buying fast fashion clothes that we would only wear for specific occasions and throw them away. By using as less things as possible, we are protecting the environment we live in and driving ourselves away from the climate crises.


<br><hr>
I found this reading to be very insightful. Thoreau's ideas and thoughts within this reading were all actual problems that are still occurring today. He provides some solutions that he truly believed could help to create positive change in society and on the world. You brought up one particular problem that I found to be the biggest problem we are currently facing. In the second half of your comment the segment that discussed "the man who goes alone..." brings up what I fear is the greatest problem modern society faces in regard to the enactment of realistic positive change. I myself have even stated in previous comments on Ken's videos that i would likely not start to implement all of the ideas that have been presented to us throughout the climate course because of the feeling that myself alone will not create a significant change. That ideology that I had previously was crushed after completing this weeks reading by Thoreau. I now see that if we are to seek and see change it has to be done by ideally everyone. This is just unrealistic thinking currently because of the state how many Americans feel about the climate crisis situation. I honestly just hope that people begin to make serious changes to how they live in their daily lives before it is too late and we cannot overcome the damage we have already started.

<br><hr>
Your response is very relatable. Walden was a very interesting read for many reasons. It’s crazy to compare how we live now with how Thoreau lived in his house, with little to no possessions. One of the things I thought was most interesting was the fact he was able to build a house under $28 dollars. Although he lacked material items, he was completely happy with his situation and felt content. I think that’s someone we all need to find in our lives. I know for sure that I long for a life where I feel content without having to buy things all the time- whether it be shoes I don’t need or an iced coffee etc. Basically, not only does having less stuff support less wasteful industries leading to less environmental damage, it helps clear your mind and help you live a more meaningful life, something that was evident in the first chapter of Walden.

<br><hr>
This chapter too, reminded me of my AP Literature class from high school. I think that my viewpoint has changed since high school after going to college and expanding my way of thinking. I had a bit of difficulty understanding the points that Thoreau was trying to make in his writing style. However, one thing that I did takeaway from this is that we truly cannot wait for a future generation to fix our problems of our present. This is completely true that the actions we take now will be the ones that have the effect and will influence our future generations as well. Unlike the previous generations that carelessly emitting those fossil fuels because it had no profound impact at the time, it is our responsibility to work to tackle those damages and evoke change. If we do not, then we will be in deep trouble and our future generations will as well. In addition, the fact is that we need to start educating the younger generation more instead of leaving them uneducated about the facts that we are currently dealing with. 
       <br><br>
It is also a fact that the world that we are living in now is so completely different from the world that Thoreau lived in. We are now motivated by more selfish desires in our capitalistic society and our drive for consumerism in everything that we do. Because of this way of thinking, this is why our world is now facing the climate crisis because fossil fuel companies care more about the profit that they make instead of how it will affect everyone else. It is our responsibility according to Thoreau to treat the world with respect and live a life more similar to that of the traditional minimalism instead.

After reading the first chapter of Thoreau’s Walden I was please
that although not entirely void of hypocrisy the effort that Thoreau put into
living as a minimalist when he had the means to live in a much nicer,
flamboyant manner was in fact admirable. 
Moreover, in his literary piece Thoreau explains that the hoarding of
material things gets in the way of our true desires to seek truths and
knowledge and to have our minds open to new possibilities not attached to
greed.  We in this modern time measure
success based on how much we consume or how people view us in regards to the
appearance of wealth we can portray to the public. But, Thoreau is able to take
his audience with him on a journey to the Pond, to the nature, to the simple
Cabin he made a home for himself in that is in essence a challenge to the
system, the same system that continues to exist today.   

<br><br>

It is of my opinion that we should gradually move towards a minimalist way of
lifestyle as a nation so that way we can all make the best of our time here on
this planet to leave the best possible environment we can to our youth, our

<p>
Thoreau’s pastoral view of nature on this planet contributes an appreciation and romanticization of a green lifestyle in conservation efforts. To promote this way of living prompts his advocacy to “simplify, simplify”, which brings to the public a motion to question their attitude on how they live affects the planet’s wellness. In the 19th century, when Walden was written, the ability for more people to make the transition from their circumstances to what Thoreau proposed was relatively easier than it is now. The modern times have been overrun with the demand for a faster pace in nearly every process. Urbanization has exponentially taken over square mile after square mile that was once home to the wildlife we have on the planet; as a result, biodiversity is lost and the carbon dioxide accumulation skyrockets even faster. At this point in time, Thoreau’s proposal is not the most feasible and sustainable option, but we all can do what we can, even if it be changing one element in our current lifestyles, to bring about a cleaner planet of harmony.

It’s interesting how the author mentions the thought that it is easier to gain than throw. For most of us nowadays are always trying to get more and more stuff in our life. The poors may even have no choice to get things they want. However, the author said that “Some things are really necessaries of life in some circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries merely, and in others still are entirely unknown.” As he said, we should be aware of what is actually the thing we need not what we want. It’s really rare that one would like to devote himself in such a self-sufficient life. He made his house himself, living in a wood that no one else stay beside him. It takes courage to start getting rid of the unnecessary, but I believe that once we only have what we need, we’ll free ourselves.

Henry David Thoreau's ideas about simplifying our lives has so much relevance in today's world. He knew that if something did not change back then, there would be nothing stopping it from overtaking the lives of people in the future. If he thought in his time that people were already materialistic and not enjoying the simpler things, he would be absolutely disgusted at how society today has become but I don't think he would be very surprised. All the things that he says we should do in order to stop being so burdened by things that do not matter hold merit in today's society even more than they did before. Minimalism not only has an effect on our own well being but as an added bonus helps us save the environment.

I am a huge fan of minimalism. I try to only buy things that I need rather than want. This is a hard lifestyle to maintain, though. Thoreau draws attention to our basic day-to-day needs and challenges his readers to think about the role we were given. I think that Thoreau would be horrified with the modern world. Life is anything but simple, and people drool over the latest and “greatest” items. Additionally, I completely understand why he was against the fashion industry. Fast fashion is a huge problem with not only environmental but human rights consequences. Food, clothing, fuel, and shelter are simple necessities everyone needs to get by. My goal is to live as close to a zero-waste lifestyle as possible, and I think that the world would be a better place if everyone tried to live more like Thoreau.

I actually have read this book in my high school AP english class. It is very inspiring and I just remember that reading because many of the students were appalled reading it. Knowing that it applied to them in every way possible. I do believe that us Americans are living a very lavish life. Having it good compared to other countries. Back in my families house in mexico , to this day I have to share cold water with all my cousins and take a shower in the backyard tub. Which is exposed to everyone outside. We don’t get these luxury  houses that accomadate to our every need. We have to make do with what we have. Even with simple ammenities such as light, We have to conserve light in mexico due to the fact that power is not something in which we can rely on. Candles are a second best. Overall it takes a man alot of courage to post a story such as this one during this time. Hopefully everyone can learn from this.

After reading Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden '' I felt challenged and inspired. Throughout his writing he explains how he has left societies and chooses to live a life of simplicity. I have a lot of respect for him and his decision. I believe it takes a lot to step outside of your role that society has placed you in. It is crazy to imagine myself living in a home the size of a garden shed. But realistically it is all we truly need. Thoreau’s article made me wonder about how different our country would be if we all were to be like him, or even try just a little bit; it would benefit our planet greatly. I think Henry David Thoreau would be disappointed to see how we all live now. He wrote this piece before our time and our lifestyles have progressively gotten worse and worse. We continue to grow more and more consumer culture. In the reading Thoreau says, “some things are really necessities of life in some circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries merely, and in others entirely unknown.” This really resonated with me, because throughout this course I have learned how wastefully us Americans live our lives. Things that are necessities to us such as a ton of clothes; a smart cell phone, a car, a large home, etc. are luxuries to people in other countries, and even unimaginable to some.

I like that you pointed out that in other countries, the average american is very wealthy. I think that "minimalism" is a great way to live for most people, but it is frustrating that so many people already do live a minimalist lifestyle, just not by choice. Wealthy people will always have the option to be greedy, while poor and impoverished people will only ever be able to  live a minimalist life. The fact that most wealthy people have this choice of greed, and often pick it, is much like a slap in the face to people who contribute to so little of the climate crisis.

The most surprising thing to me about Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" was how early the idea of minimalism was brought about. I had no clue that even back in those times were people so immersed in gaining riches. However, it seems almost obvious now. Even though riches might have evolved to more cars, high-end fashion, or bigger houses throughout the years, people always sought after the wealth of their time. Ken makes an interesting point when articulating on happiness and how it is not attainable solely through money and material things. Time and time again, this can be seen through looking at the lives of certain celebrities who had everything that money can buy, yet fell into depression and slew of other things, some of them ultimately committing suicide. You cannot put a price tag on happiness; this is something that we as a society have to realize. We should take heed to Thoreau's message, lest we suffer the consequences. It was also interesting to hear Thoreau's opinion on diet. I never would have thought that vegetarianism was a concept at that time. While his words may be overly involved or his message complex, he still effectively articulates the implications of man's avarice. For us to live with sustenance on this planet, we must forego all of the superfluous and material wealth that does nothing for us as humans, and we must come to the realization that we are not the only beings on this earth, and we definitely will not be the last.

After reading the "Walden" written by Henry David Thoreau, I found that over consume would have negative effects on the environment. Human desire is very strong, especially for luxury goods.Everyone dreams of owning a car and a house, and it is this excessive desire and pursuit of luxury goods that has caused this situation.Luxury clothes pile up at home that people can't even wear once a year.This is a huge waste and has a very bad impact on the environment.We must learn to recycle and reuse, reduce unnecessary waste, and control everyone's desires to meet their daily needs.

Henry David Thoreau wrote Walden in 1854. Thoreau, he is the pioneer of the modern minimalist movement. Thoreau showed his worries about the fashion industry. He explained about simplicity in his book. And I believe that the minimalist movement will largely change one’s life. However, mostly, people could not be minimalist. Useless social connections, food waste and so on. It is easy to say that we should reduce water waste, food waste or simplify our social circle. However, it hard to do so. 
<br><br>
Also, I believe that there are a lot of benefit of being a minimalist. First of all, I help us save a lot of money. As a college student, I have limited money on entertainment, traveling or cloths. Being a minimalist could help us reduce consumption of eating, clothing, and commuting. Secondly, being a minimalist could help us save more time. In the past 3 years in college, I went to a lot of parties to make friends and did a lot of useless social connections and that makes me look really busy. However, in fact, I could save those time for some more important things like studying.

After reading the first chapter “Walden” written by Henry David Thoreau, I found that I agree with his simplistic lifestyle however my current lifestyle is drastically different. We glamorize our lives with no real function to it.If we all thought in the concept of need versus excess, we could largely impact our carbon footprint. This relates not only to our products and services, but also to our own food consumption.

Henry David Thoreau's book was a piece of literature that I had to read in high school and reading it now gave me a bit of a different take on the book. You begin to notice why he did what he did and understand the consumerism aspect that bothered him. The feeling of living a minimalistic life is key to him. The book reflects the 19th century and as I begin to think about today's century I notice how consumerism had taken over our way of thinking. We begin to think that to live a happy life, we would have to have a big house and the mindset that "money can buy happiness". Although I do think that statement is true, that is only because you need money for everything. From medical bills, to putting food on our tables. Everything just costs money now-a-days. But, I cannot neglect the fact that it is possible to live small/ "savage" and still live a happy life, people do it all the time, especially in 3rd world countries. By Thoreau taking on the challenge of living minimal, it really gave us a look into how people view those who live that way as he separates them by "civilized" and "savages". Now we just think, "How can we change people's mentality?". It is truly difficult because of how those that would be considered "civilized" raised us.

After reading Walden for the second time I am even more convinced that desire leads to overconsumption which is contributing greatly to the climate crisis. The fact that we are a nation of overconsumption is driven by our western ideal to have the bigger and better product. As people we neglect the world and it’s resources that are provided for us. Walden takes an interesting and  seemingly effective approach which shows us how to cut ties with our desire. If we live a life of simplicity then the need or want for anything extra would be eradicated. By receiving fulfillment in the simple things in life  we transcend the materialistic barrier of the world and are able to find happiness. I believe that Walden is a great example of how the average person can contribute to the prevention of the climate change. Overconsumption as mentioned before in this course, was on of the top contributors to the climate crisis. As Americans we eat, drink, and drive at an alarming rate in relation to other poorer countries. If people found happiness in the simplicity of life as Walden suggest then there would be no need for anything extra. Once this happens then we could see a shift in the amount of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere. Less consumption means less production which leads to a better climate. Not to mention it also means better working conditions for other people in countries where sweat shops are there reality. I’m not saying that we need to radically change the way every human lives because that would be impossible. What I am saying is that we as a society really need to re-evaluate what we really really want. We have to stop viewing our desires as necessities and start focusing on how to keep our home healthy.

I agree with many of the points you make in this comment. In theory, living a simple life would be beneficial for planet earth. Walden demonstrates through the practice of a simple lifestyle and the critique of exaggerated human desire/consumption, that clearly such a way of life reduces ones waste and carbon footprint. But the truth of the matter is that, simplicity is not a viable option. Human desire is at the core of society. It is the pursuit of the good life that creates markets and governments. I think that it would be much more effective in redefining the good life in a way that is perceived far more appealing than living luxuriously. The altruistic approach to the problem of climate change is the wishful thinking that people will one day cut ties with their desires and be content with the simple things in life. Unfortunately, this is not practical. Walden is a special character, a philosopher who is more of an outlier amongst the layperson. That is why he influenced people like Chris McCandless, the main character in the book "Into the Wild". The task should not be to simplify, the task should be to make simplicity most appealing.

found Henry David Thoreau's call for a simple life appealing. Throughout the chapter, he shows us how people sacrifice their lives to fit in and have their own homes. But the saddest thing is that owning or renting that house makes them poorer than they were before. I think Thoreau marveled at how hard people had to adapt and how they felt that having a bigger house and new clothes would lead them to a happier life, but that wasn't necessarily true. These people have spent years working hard on these material things, but as Thoreau said, they have no time to learn and question their own ignorance. So what is the meaning of their lives? Life works for material things, without time to expand your knowledge and problems, life doesn't seem to be a very good life for me.
<br><br>
I do, however, find some of Thoreau's Suggestions overblown. I think his whole reason for not trading is a bit too much. He claimed that this would lead to the devil, and I guess what he meant was that it would lead him to want to spend more money. However, I think if you want to live a life without overconsumption, it's best to eat a little of everything. The more you deny yourself, the more you crave them. If you consume the right amount of stuff and are aware of the impact of what you buy, you should be fine. Also, when Thoreau mentioned dorms for college students, I thought of UCSB and my current lifestyle. The cost of living here is so high that my economy is overdrawn. I had the idea of building a place like Thoreau, but then realized that it was impossible at this point. I don't have the necessary skills and I can't get city approval. So how do we address UCSB's high housing costs? It is these costs that have led to large Numbers of students taking out loans and have severely affected them financially. I think some students are getting an education to get out of poverty, but in the process, they are getting poorer than before.

I think consumerism is very bad. It will bring a lot of burden and waste to society and the planet. In fact, we don't need that much. But I think minimalism is also inappropriate. Many things are not commodities but they are essentially commodities. Such as education, health and living environment. I'm curious how much carbon emissions each additional student will get to college. When the author spends a lot of time building a log cabin by himself, it may reduce a lot of carbon emissions, but living in the United States itself is a high carbon emission thing. I think we need to find a balance between efficiency and environmental protection.
<br><br>

I think taxing carbon emissions can effectively solve some problems. It can both reduce people's demand for carbon emissions and encourage people to develop new energy sources. It can also use the collected taxes to purify the air.

My first reaction to Thoreau’s “Walden” reading was surprise. In 1854 when this was published I am shocked that anyone would wish to live more simply and with less. Living a “rustic life” on the shores near Concord, Massachusetts is no easy task as I know how cold it can get there. Obviously, I was not alive at the time but knowing that there was much less “stuff” on the planet then there is now I can’t imagine feeling too overwhelmed with whatever “mechanized materialistic waste” was going on then. 
<br><br>


On the other hand, I do relate to the feeling that Thoreau had--wanting to escape the world’s craziness and really get back to the basics. For the past eleven years of my life I have attended Gold Arrow Camp--a children’s summer sleep away camp that is very much into low-tech and high-nature. We were not allowed to use cell phones or have any sort of tech there and instead we did fun activities and literally played in nature. Those were probably the two weeks out of every year that I felt the happiest and most pure--because none of my materialistic “stuffs” defined me, I could just be myself and that was more than enough. 

<br><br>

I like the viewpoint of Thoreau as the great grandparent of the minimalist movement because he really was! When people do radical things word spreads and I’m sure many of the people close to him at the time of his back-to-nature journey knew about his plans. These people may have felt positively or negatively about it but what’s important is Thoreau got his story and purpose out. This goes hand in hand with the concept of rewriting the script that is given to us at birth--the fact is we need to change it and no generation has done so thus far. Impactful people like the Dalai Lama’s who basically agree with minimalism and Thoreau can say all they want but it is going to take active change from many individuals to accomplish anything.

<br><br>

Personally, I’m not too optimistic about the greater population getting behind taking action to stop/ improve the climate crisis. While I wish that everyone would take action (knowledge that is acted upon is power!)--I really don’t think this is the case. There are too many people that care far too much about possessions and would not give that up for the chance at a better future for the planet. There is too much long term gratification involved and not enough short term reward for people to be enticed.

If Henry David Thoreau were to be here today, he would be pretty disappointed in our society today. The sizes of homes have grown tremendously in square footage and it only continues to grow as more people want bigger houses. Our culture’s view of “bigger is better” is dangerous because what used to be considered normal is now too small and is creating tremendous negative consequences for the environment.
<br><br>


I think the life Thoreau lived in his cabin would be something of the utmost experience. I sometimes imagine what would it be to leave everything and go off somewhere you’re far away from society to just be with nature. You would not be concerned with having the new Gucci bag or not having the new iPhone because you would just be with yourself, without all of these materialistic items, so that you can really be with yourself. Having a house just the right size for a person and a small garden in the back would be pleasant. You would not feel like your place is stuffy with too many items and everything would look cozy and organized because you have everything you need in your home. I think this is a life (or some form of it) that we should all be living in because in this day in age, we are less connected with the world around us and put a lot of emphasis on materialistic items and I feel like we are letting life pass us. I don’t know, I just think there is more to life than working multiple days a week to buy new gadgets and such. Sometimes I feel like I would rather not be in school and instead be somewhere else where I could be with nature, read and paint, and spend time with the people I care about and focus on myself. I just have this notion that we should make the most of our lives and make it meaningful and I feel like Thoreau’s life choices are a way to get there.

I think "Walden" is a really good starter read for someone looking more into helping the environment. Yes the chapter we read had extremist ideas of living in a shack, only buying necessities, and doing odd jobs to have enough money to survive, but in the process you would learn more about the land and people surrounding you. People work until the day that they die so they can buy the latest designer outfits, and the only satisfaction it creates is wearing said outfit once or twice until you throw it away for the next. Less stuff is less to worry about. I really like the minimalism expressed in the chapter. He lived off his land and didn't need expensive luxuries to feel secure to survive. I strive to be anywhere close to this. Having to worry about clothes or useless things I won't care about a month from now is so time consuming and exhausting. If I only spend money on necessities I have more money for going places and making actual experiences. Living in a huge house seems so useless to me and lonely. I don't want to have expensive things just to brag one moment and feel unfulfilled the next. I also loved the odd jobs, it's more experience in random skills but he also bonded and got to know his community, it seems quite happy really. I just think that it's a happier way to live with also helping the environment by not giving into extreme consumerism. Less is more.

Thoreau provides us a new life style through Walden. Although, the experience of living in the forest just is a experiment of Thoreau, it has a profound influence on the environmental viewpoint of people. The passage inspires some people to live in the nature. To feel the nature closely. Also, nowadays consumption become a popular culture around us. we cannot control the desire to but luxurious things, even we will not often use them. From the book, we should learn to reduce the expenditure on clothes and other things. To make our space smaller, to think about what is the thing we really need. We need to minus some unnecessary things from out life.

In the first chapter of Thoreau's Walden, he detached himself from society and chose a life based on simple principles. In this chapter, Thoreau has been preaching the benefits of a minimalist lifestyle. The less material wealth there is, the more inner wealth there is. Clearly, he believes that the pressure to make the most money and own meaningless goods will force us to sacrifice the real gains in life. Thoreau's years at Walden pond were arguably more personally and environmentally beneficial. As a society, the less pressure we feel to acquire these meaningless luxuries, the better for the environment because production will be reduced and so will our carbon footprint. It is not only our material environment that will benefit from Thoreau's ideals but also our spiritual environment. In his response to the video, Ken says that in order to save our planet, even if there is only a small chance, we must abandon the goal of living in luxury for happiness. In order for future generations to live happier lives, we must change the notion that more possessions equal more happiness.

Although I think that what Thoreau did was very interesting, I think it’s extremely difficult for people nowadays to just leave everything behind and go live off the grid.  I think that Thoreau  is one of the biggest influencers for climate awareness. He might not have been aware at the time but looking back at what we believed in, it’s easy to conclude that he was pushing towards a healthier life with the planet. Talking about this “script,” I began to think about my own script and how I have personally followed it and never even thought twice about changing my ways. Thoreu is very brave and I admire him for his ability to just take a path that’s not taken. I think it’s very surprising that he is very rich but strives to seem poor. This is obviously the complete opposite of what people nowadays strive for and we must find new sources of happiness because it seems like destroying our planet is what is making us happy.

Things are easier said than done. I completely agree with your opinion that leaving everything behind to live off the grid is very difficult to people, especially for those with friends and family that they simply can't even consider living without. Thoreau, being the great influencer he is, has many positive habits for which we could individually adopt without having to go to the extremes of going off the grid. Just because there is a script we have been trained to follow that doesn't mean it can't be modified. Society should stop worrying about the negative opinions of others because one is choosing to alter the script that has been constructed for us, and instead should be trying to be the positive influence for themselves and for those who acknowledge and choose to hop onto a truly positive trend. In concurrence with you, we should all be striving for new sources of happiness that is actually genuine and doesn't produce all this negative damage toward our world, and our lives.

Being from Boston I grew up going to Walden Pond all the time. The remains of Thoreau's wooden cabin are still standing and I have vivid memories of how shocked I was by how small the structure is. At the time I couldn't even fathom the idea of living such a simple life. After reading Walden in high school however I found it a lot easier to accept the idea that a minimalist lifestyle may be the key to a better and more fulfilling lifestyle. Thoreau criticizes the materialist and damaging attitudes of society and offers ways to help improve. I found the idea about challenging your given role really interesting. If we as a society all take on the roles given to use our world is going to be in great danger. Our generation needs to break the patterns of pollution, industrialization, and wastefulness that have been passed down for decades. Thoreau argues that the ultimate power for change is within each individual. We all need to be accountable for our own actions and adjust our lifestyles in order to improve the livelihood of ourselves and ultimately society.

I have probably read this chapter about four times in my life now. I had to read the whole book in high school and I remember that I despised it back then. I don't think I hated it because of the content, but for how the content was stated, since I did not really pay attention to it back then. When I reread this last quarter, I found that I did not hate it anymore. I actually began admiring Thoreau for his decisions and how he tried to persuade people to live a simpler, less materialistic life. I agree. To put it simply, I agree. I think that people need to start letting go of possessions that they don't need, such as having multiple cars or a huge mansion. I remember when I was younger and thought that, if I were to become successful, I would need to invest in those things to showcase that I was breaking away from what I was supposed to be. As I have learned since then, I do not have to, nor should I, do that. 
<br><br>
I actually quite like thinking about how we need to break away from the role we were given at birth. I feel as if I have already done that, considering how different I am from my parents, family and peers that I was surrounded by when I was growing up. This is not to say that I am a total minimalist, but I think I am a lot less materialistic than I was "supposed" to be. I no longer want a fancy car or a big house and I know that having a lot of things will not improve my quality of life. I don't think I could go into the woods and build a cabin to live in like Thoreau did, but this reading is a good example of how someone can simplify their life and learn that they do not need to own millions of things to be happy.

Thoreau makes a great point in building our own place such as a wooden tent. His ideas are realistic, the only things a human needs to survive is shelter, food, water, and warmth, therefore, he proposes that people can live a simpler life. I completely agree with him, I believe we can be the generation to change environmental issues but only if we are willing to give up our current lifestyle. It may be difficult for many people in our generation to start making the change because not only is technology advancing more and more every day but we are becoming lazier because of it. Many of us would rather prefer an easier and faster way of living because we are at a point in our lives where almost everything is run by machines and not by human hands. This is a problem because we are not willing to work and put in the labor to build things for our own which are safer and more eco-friendly. For example, instead of walking to school someone would rather drive their car because it's faster and more convenient for them. Today's generation is filled with media propaganda, celebrity's lives, technology, and social media that influence the way we dress, live and act. This influence prevents humans from wanting to live a simpler lifestyle because they have developed a mindset of achieving similar goals of celebrities that have contributed massively to the climate crisis. All in all, I believe many people would start practicing a simpler lifestyle if living a minimalist life was more trendy in the media. For instance, switching to a vegetarian or vegan meal plan is now more commonly seen through celebrities which make it more favorable to the population. We have the power in our hands to be the generation to change the climate crisis so why shouldn't we at least try and some people in action are better than no one in action.

Thoreau's environmentalist idea of exiting society and abandoning the materialistic values we hold in society is very opening; living in a world that doesn't favor the grand yet chaotic values of large city complexes is something that people don't often explore. Assimilating into a natural environment would definitely change the world for the better and relieve the negative impacts that climate change has had on the planet. The first chapter of Walden has a very interesting commentary on materialism and what we choose to value in life; should we put effort into things that are straining the environment? His experiment with moving away from the big city was kind of groundbreaking for the time, and its impact that it has had on society is undeniable. If everyone strove to improve themselves the way Walden chose to do so, the world would no doubt be a better place, but alas it is not. There are so many things that we could be doing better but we choose not to.

Thoreau chose to run away from the materialized world. He was tired of chasing power and wealth. Fancy clothings mean nothing to him. From a journalist to an “isolated” writer, Thoreau made a brave decision: chase your own wonderful life. Walden is not a big lake, and Thoreau lived there everyday. In a small cabinet, he found everything he wanted: simple life and simple stuff. He ate simply, wore simply and lived simply. Ken mentioned that Thoreau was a vegetarian. His life was simple but healthy. Just imagine that, you wake up on the lovely morning, hear birds singing and enjoy wonderful lake views from your small cabin. Away from big cities, that’s the life that many people want to have but fear to have. Many people nowadays are stressed out about everything from fast growing societies. We chase wealth and power. We want to have big houses and fancy cars. We will be stressful when chasing these materials too hard. Many people appreciate Thoreau’s lifestyles, but few of them will be willing to give up what they now have to live for a simpler life.
<br><br>

I really appreciate Thoreau’s courage to chase what he wants. We do not need to do the exact same things as Thoreau does. Maybe we can start to change our lifestyles by many small things like reducing car use and eating more vegetables. These things might seem simple to you, but this means a lot for the environment.

Henry David Thoreau, an environmentalist, a minimalist, and a philosopher, discusses how he believes people should live their lives/what is essential to life in the first chapter of his book Walden. I think it is very interesting the way Thoreau explains the way humanity became reliant on what he thinks of as luxury. Thoreau mentions how humans have invented houses, clothes, and cooked food and discovered the warmth of fire, all of which at first were not a necessity to life, but quickly become necessities. Thoreau mentions how Darwin noticed that people who were used to sitting by a fire were completely normal, possibly even still cold, whereas “naked savages” were sweating profusely. This explains how humans have normalized technology and what used to be considered luxury into daily life. What Thoreau thinks of as luxury may be very little to some people and this is how consumerism has spiraled out of control. 
<br><br>

I agree with Thoreau about the fashion industry and how it is a perfect example of people wanting things they don’t need. The fashion industry is fascinating because it is so successful in encouraging people to buy clothes they do not need, otherwise it wouldn’t be a successful industry. Logically it doesn't make sense for people to spend their money on clothes when they have enough for survival, but since humans are pack animals, we strive for status, esteem, and social connection from other humans, therefore it allows for the fashion industry to get people to continue buying clothes. I think Thoreau makes many valid points about the true meaning of life and how having more things does not equal happiness. Many environmental solutions require a change of lifestyle and a change of perspective on life. If we shift our values and focus less on material things then it is possible that we can address many environmental issues and be happier people.

I have read Walden in my high school. Honestly, this is an expressive book. Thoreau's thoughts and actions were unique and advancing at that time period. As he knew the danger of the climate change regards to the environment and human's life, he tried to minimize the resources cost and waste produced by living in an original environment. I firstly thought it was amazing because most no one would like to abandon their life in cities but living in an old cabin near Walden Lake. Thoreau gives up his luxurious life; instead, he worked by himself, including planting food and building houses, he uses resources in nature around him. He refers a simple and practical life as everyone images. Thoreau as a single was environmental friendly, however, his idea of living near Walden Lake was also unresponsive. He only lived there for two years. After that, he returned his home. Living away from the problem of climate change was selfish because Thoreau did not need to care about the impact of climate crisis on the planet as he was living away from the human habitats. He also did not need to communicate to other people to figure out the solution regards to the environmental problems. He ran away from these issues and impacts that caused by all human beings. Thoreau had the responsibility of fix these problems. He changed himself was a good start. As everyone changed like Thoreau did to reduce the risks to the environment, problems of climate change could be solved in the future generations.

After reading the first chapter of “Walden”, I think it’s frustrating that we have “no time to be anything but a machine.” In this materialistic world, people always deem wealth as the only thing that makes their lives “happier”. But is the statement true? Personally, I disagree. Those stuff we can buy with the money we create always much exceed the basic requirement of our life, and the time we spend on creating and creating makes our lives more an more stressful. There are definitely things in the world that are more important than what we can buy; the sudden death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant simply made me realize how fragile life could be, and how much I should treasure my life and people I love. To me, life is happy as long as I’m loved and living a simple life offers me a rest from the “noisy world”.

My first impression when first introduced to Walden was that Thoreau was out of his mind because who else lives as a recluse from society in a tiny cabin in the woods. As I read more I start to understand his reasons. The simplicity Thoreau had after eliminating most of his stuff brought him peace. Even though Thoreau was wealthy for someone in the 1800s, he still wanted to make that transition and experiment living in isolation for a few years. One of the most insightful points from this reading is that he found that with only 6 weeks of work he could meet all of his expenses to live. 6 weeks of work in today’s standards is almost nothing, we’re so accustomed as a society to live in an endless cycle of working to be able to buy things. If we, just like Thoreau, only lived with what we absolutely needed like shelter, clothing, and food we wouldn’t have to spend our entire lives working. We could work one day out of the week and enjoy the rest of the week for leisure. But we don’t because of how unreasonable it seems, most people wouldn’t want to live in a tiny house with nothing in it and we’ve become so attached to materials that stopping seems impossible.

Although Thoreau was at times difficult to follow, the underlying messages he conveyed really hit home. In particular, these quotes stood out to me:  “Most men… are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them...the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day… he has no time to be anything but a machine.” These quotes make me consider what it means to have “a true integrity”? What do we consider to be the “true necessaries and means of life”? He also brings up the idea of inheritance and how we inherit our way of life. We are born into a certain lifestyle and as we grow up, we get locked into this cycle of working and consuming, so much so that we are unable to reap the benefits from that cycle. We learn how to function like machines because that is the only option we believe to be possible. He quotes Confucious, “To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge.” To consider an alternative lifestyle, one must acknowledge that what we know is not all that there is to know. Herein lies the challenge to question our reality and consider what is possible beyond it. I found it interesting that this was written in the nineteenth century, yet these messages are even more so prevalent today.

Upon reading Walden by Henry David Thoreau I was at first baffled and did not really know or understand what was being said. As I continued, I was surprised and amazed that issues regarding lifestyles and consumerism have been a topic of discussion since the 19th century. Issues and problems regarding our need to consume and obtain more and more have been around for longer than I would have imagined. I like how Thoreau promotes the idea of living a minimalist lifestyle while delegitimizing those portrayed as lavish or “civilized.” In his time, living a civilized life meant spending and consuming more and more just to fit in, while the lifestyle that was labeled as “savage” was ultimately the best option. Had we listened to what Thoreau proclaimed, minimalist lifestyles would be more prevalent in our society today. I liked how Ken described our lives as being born “into a role.” Much of what we do today is justified by one thing: it is how we have always done it. Much of our culture, especially consumerism, is only still around because it has been ingrained into our society. We need to break away from this cycle and actually combat anthropogenic climate change by altering the ways that we live. Our generation will be known as either the generation that actually helped fix climate change or the generation that doomed the rest. We cannot follow in the same footsteps as our previous generation who failed to identify that there was a problem and that to this that still mostly denies the issue. Not only must we assert that the issue exists, we must also provide ways in which we can fix it. Only then can we work our way to saving our planet from annihilation by none other than us.

In Henry David Thoreau’s “ Walden”, he wrote about consumerism and shifting back to a simpler way of life. It is very interesting and surprises me a lot. First of all, I like Thoreau’s opinion that modern society is supposed to put more emphasis on the function of the stuff, instead of its fashion, which is consumerisms. Nowadays, people are seeking fashion and ignoring the usefulness of the items, which causes serious waste. However, from another aspect, the acquires towards fashions also prompt the economy and fashion related industry, bringing stronger purchasing power. Therefore, it’s a coin with two sides. All in all, the arguments Thoreau makes are really interesting and worth us to think about.

This past week, the reading took us back to Henry David Thoreau and the basis of what it means to live a simple life. Walden is a work that is part autobiographical and part fiction, and in the piece, he writes about living a simple life and explores the gap between the rich at the poor (even though he himself historically did not live entirely alone in his experiment, and he himself was rather well off): “Why should they eat their sixty acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born?” he asks, bringing back to the question of: what does the Earth owe us? He emphasizes that the “the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation” and that lives as a whole mean nothing if we do not appreciate it.

From this week's reading and Ken's lecture on "Walden," I learned and realized that consumerism exists so much in today's civilization. People have so many desires every single day and want to expand their possessions because they want to have what they want. However, sometimes people should consider leading a happy, but simplistic life with the necessities they truly need throughout life instead of engaging in a materialistic values in their daily lives. Human beings can totally be content with what they have even if it everything they had were just simple but very significant necessities. We, unfortunately including myself, are sometimes too focused on what we WANT instead of what we NEED. Also, I really enjoyed how the author touched on the subject between "civilized" and "savages." The fact that "civilized homes" were visualized as places where we can't simply afford with comfort was astonishing because they can't provide the happiness and necessity the people can actually pay for. While the "civilized" homes brought struggles for the people to afford, the "savages" homes were the common (or even less than common) homes that were small and affordable. And although it was small, it performed the basic necessities that kept the residents safe and sound. Therefore, I learned a lot from "Walden" because it touches on today's civilization's greed and consumerism economy, which not only affect our comfort in our daily lives, but ultimately also our entire planet.

“We have built for this world a family mansion, and for the next a family tomb”. This quote by Henry David Thoreau encapsules his famous book “Walden.” This book focuses on the idea of a simplistic lifestyle that is possible, but overlooked and even frowned upon because of the influence of living in a capitalist economy. Although this book was written in the 19th century, it still somehow applies today. Society is so wrapped around the idea that status and wealth is measured on materialistic items- such as the clothes you wear, the size of your home and the amount of things you possess- that we tend to forget the real cost and burden this is on our precious planet earth.  Thoureau emphasizes that the idea of being “rich” or “poor” is abstract, and the true cost behind it all. We live in a materialistic world where one’s outfit or amount of possessions essentially defines one’s status and wealth. However, one can be wealthy by living a simplistic lifestyle and a peaceful mind. A person does not need to own and keep up with the latest fashion trends or own a huge home in order to be considered wealthy. Thoreau recognized the true cost behind a capitalist economy, and the irreversible damage this will essentially have on Earth. I truly believe that being “rich” or “poor” is simply a state of mind, and does not have to be based on materialistic things. One can achieve being content and satisfied living a simplistic lifestyle without having to place a burden on Earth and future generations that will soon inhabit it.

As I started to read the first chapter of Walden by Thoreau, it made me realize that living a simplistic life has large benefits besides helping the environment. Thoreau’s free time to explore and pay attention to nature made me realize that because he was living a more simplistic life he was able to appreciate it more. Most of the time humans are always on the move that we don’t stop to appreciate our surroundings. I feel that’s what detaches us from not only nature but ourselves too. If we don’t stop to appreciate nature then how are we supposed to feel the need to save it? Also, it leaves little room to stop and think about what we want for our own lives. It shows how a simplistic lifestyle could essentially help someone become more mindful of their decisions. The effort Thoreau put into building his own home and furniture seemed to me that it would make someone appreciate their belongings more. This is due to the fact that a person, such as Thoreau, put in this time and effort to construct something that would be useful to them for years. It helps decrease that idea of compulsive consumerism because you’re least likely to buy something to replace something you’ve built. Apart from that, you’re also able to see all the environmental impacts and costs it took to achieve that outcome. I wish someone would recreate this “experiment” today in order to see what the costs would be in order to achieve what Thoreau did. Since a lot of the prices seemed too good to be true but it was a different time period.

Thoreau’s piece opened up how the excess of possessions can lead to an excess of constrain and worry. It also requires an increase in time and labor in order to retrieve these items as well. I think that Thoreau was able to spread a positive message throughout the first chapter of his work, showcasing the ability to live a fulfilling yet frugal and simple lifestyle. Walden keeps a  focus on food, shelter, clothing and fuel, revealing how individuals often seek luxuries beyond this which inhibits an expansion of inner freedom. 
<br><br>

I think that Thoreaus’s  approach to explaining the importance of simplicity can be difficult to fathom because many people do not have access to an area where they can essentially build a house and survive for months on end, spending little to nothing in order to survive. This does not lessen my belief that we all should take a second look at our consumption and what we chose to indulge in but different social factors must be considered in order to do this. We constantly hear new ideas and ways to adjust our lifestyle and habits but these are often geared towards individuals who have the resources and ability to adopt new practices. 
<br><br>

Thoreau’s piece evoked a range of emotions from me, considering my desires for new material possessions. Throughout my past four years at UCSB, I have encountered two instances that led me to question the point in purchasing clothes, shoes, decorations, etc; essentially making way for my current outlook on “simplicity.”  At the end of each school year, I did not have a way of transportation back home, which is five hours away. I had to catch the Amtrak and bring what I could carry. I had to get rid of so many different things, ranging from clothes and shoes to furniture and exercise equipment. I remember crying because I had to leave behind the stuff that I have worked for. This caused me to look at material possessions in a different light, lessening my desire for them because they do not last forever. I think it can be unhealthy to attach ourselves to such things because we will never be fully satisfied since there will always be something new and worth having.

In Thoreau’s reading, readers are exposed to his beliefs of living a simple life, and setting out of one's routine to understand the meaning of life. One of the most powerful statements in this reading was in regards to how people tend to be “occupied with the factitious and superfluously courses labors of life” in a country where we have so much freedom. It's ironic to think we have allowed ourselves to truly fall into a consumer based world without acknowledging and understanding the negative effects. Personally, reading of the statements regarding clothes had an impact on me the most. Like many others, I don’t discard clothing when it is no longer usable, often times, I do it when I get new clothing or when it’s no longer considered fashionable. It's a never ending cycle that causes one to never be content with what they have. Henry David Thoreau’s challenge to an “overly bloated life” is both informative and needed. I definitely think he was onto something because to have written about the importance of challenging one’s role and stepping out of their daily routines in the 19th century in order to live a more simple lifestyle should have people pause and ask themselves why they should consider incorporate this into their lives. In a time where more and bigger is seen as better, I think it’s important to acknowledge how our actions and lifestyles can be toxic not only for our planet, but also ourselves. If we could see Thoreau’s reaction to this 21 century consumer based, it world would be pure disappointment. We have become a wasteful and materialistic society who don't see downsizing as a way to demonstrate one's success.

In this reading, Thoreau expresses how he thinks that live a simplistic life is important and how he lives it. All the stuff beyond what human nature really needs is unnecessary, and will only make you miserable and ended up in a vicious cycle of wanting more and never fulfilled. Our happiness should not be built only upon the desires of material things. I’m surprised that Thoreau had these ideas about consumerism as early as the 19th century, because the problems of consumerism have grown much bigger these days. I wonder maybe we will live even happier if we get rid of all the unnecessary and live simpler.

<p>
After reading Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, it’s clear that the simplified lifestyle he preached about is even more important to keep as of right now. The heavily pushed agenda of consumerism leads to the waste of so many natural resources today which ultimately serves no purpose other than destroying the Earth’s natural environment. Luxuries themselves are not beneficial towards humans as they provide nothing inherently necessary for our lives. Walden shows us that we should apply this simple lifestyle in an effort to not stress over insignificant materialistic items and in turn feel a sense of happiness that derives from living a minimalist life.

<p>
Even before the turn of the 20th century, Thoreau was demonstrating concern about a society that wad becoming increasingly material and more wasteful. The essay, Walden, outlines a form of test completed by Thoreau, in which he practices a very minimalistic lifestyle for just over two years. This conservative project was intended to highlight the personal benefits that come with cutting back. The dimensions of the home given from Walden sort of mirror those of the tiny houses filmed in the documentary Minimalism. Even over 150 years later, people who are using exactly the amount they need to survive and function happily feel still just as happy, even in an era of mass consumption like ours today. With necessities simplified to food, fuel, shelter and clothing, some degree of complication is lost along with the presence of clutter. I’m not entirely sure if there is an exact turning point, exactly an amount of goods you would have to trash to find happiness. I know it doesn’t work like that, but it just points to the fact that there is no perfect way to practice minimalistic living with minimal goods. Each person has an equilibrium that would promote serenity and contentment over trivial items. Even before the boom of the 20th century, Thoreau was still thoughtful enough to demonstrate concern for the selfish tendencies of Americans. He clearly feared for the mass accumulation of various stuffs that were coming along with the developing capitalistic and consumerist culture. Even despite the environmental impact of shrinking your carbon consumption and promoting a less wasteful lifestyle, minimalism is personally beneficial to its practitioners.

In the 21st century, as the city with the rapid development of science and technology, the environment is deteriorating. The fresh air in the past is long gone, replaced by gasoline. Sometimes, I want to go outside, breathing the fresh air and to listen to the sounds of nature. Listen to the sounds of nature, such as tree rustle, birds song. Henry David Thoreau’s Walden meet my idea. Thoreau in the book with their own hands to make his seclusion seem simple and full of meaning. In Walden lake, spindle sound, the sound of the wind blows over. Even the rippling lake have a voice.
<br><br>

Mr. Henry David Thoreau is thinking, thinking about life. Thinking about nature. People tend to rush in their life, and don't know what they missing. In a busy world, maybe we should slow down and listen to our heart. 
<br><br>

This book inspires me a lot: What is necessary for life? Someone complained that couldn't afford to buy a house, Thoreau built for $28 a cabin. People cannot solve the food and clothing, Thoreau to grow crops every week?
<br><br>
True harmony is in tune with nature, such as spring flowers or leaves fall in autumn.

Reading Henry David Thoreau’s first chapter of “Walden” made me more open to the thought of living a simplistic lifestyle. Thoreau starts off by commenting on the restrictions that material possessions have to the freedom in one’s life, and specifically refers to men who inherit land and how they do not have a true sense of freedom. This can easily be related to the materialistic mindset of our society today. What suprised me the most about this reading is how applicable it is to the world we live in today, even though it was published in 1854.  Thoreau says at one point in the chapter, “while civilization has been improving our houses, it has not equally improved the men who are to inhabit them.” This quote goes to show that even back then people were money-hungry and materialistic, and have not changed. His introduction to Walden is a call to action in changing the course of mankind and defying the societal norms that created a mentality that the more materialistic items you have, the better your life is. When you consider what is truly necessary in life, you realize how pointless so many luxury items we have are. In today’s day and age, there is even more pressure to fit in and show off how much money you have because of social media’s pervasiveness and the pressure individuals have to look like they have it all. This chapter not only showed me the importance of simplicity, but also how much work it is going to take to change the greedy, deep-rooted ideals of people in our society.

Henry David Thoreau is indeed a true environmentalist. He does so by writing this ‘how-to’ manual on how to radically reduce our carbon footprint and to focus on our surroundings more. Still, who is Thoreau to tell someone On their impact towards the environment when he himself grew up in a privileged household—one that would Forsure go against his beliefs as an environmentalist. Thoreau failed to see how romanticizing the environment would result in the degradation of the forest/country side with people moving to the country after reading thoreaus work—degrading the environment. Thoreau does a great job doing his work under a pastoral mode because it attracts people in the city who are looking for an escape—the countryside where the city problems won’t find them.

This reading was interesting in the way that he discusses specific topics that are still very relevant to this day. The commentary about jobs, loans for property, and clothes are still some of the biggest issues with the climate today. Though I understood his message, I still do not fully agree with his comments about slavery regarding the North and South because no flawed ideology could be worse than physically holding people against their will. I still support his view of the flawed ideology that people work for the wrong reasons and need to have better priorities in life. Thoreau's message might be a bit more extreme than the one I stated but the general idea is the same. I noticed the comment how he stated that people are unfortunate enough to be born to inherit barns and farms because of the responsibility that comes with it and your life is already decided and saying it as a bad thing when many would take it as a blessing to land and found it intriguing because he puts such a low priority on material things.  Even beds other more normal luxuries or borderline necessities are talked down upon by Thoreau and really show his view on the topic. In the end, I think his views are too extreme for me to be realistic but still interest me a great deal because of how his commentary has stayed relevant for all these years and how his philosophies would truly save the environment.

One line that really resonated with me from Walden was, “The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the others?” Success in our culture has become so defined by material wealth, by a large house, luxurious car, and expensive vacations, that many don’t want to abandon those ideals for fear of being labelled a failure. Most people don’t want to be humbled by downsizing, a sad fact considering, as Thoreau argued, that the former way of life has become so exaggerated in its importance. Possessions do not signify wealth or happiness, yet in many cases people will go out of their way and into debt in order to appear wealthy, because they think that an indulgent lifestyle is an indicator of success.
<br><br>

“This is the only way, we say; but there are as many ways as there can be radii drawn from one centre.” Most of us, Thoreau pointed out, have become so set in our ways that we don’t even acknowledge the other options, let alone pursue them. This is why I think it’s so important for things like the Minimalism documentary to be on big platforms like Netflix: the more exposure these alternative lifestyles get, the more people will begin to see them as viable and realistic options (a necessary step to changing our society’s current environmentally-detrimental way of life).

One of the aspects of "Walden" that I found most fascinating was Thoreau's idea that most people work too hard. This idea is completely contradictory to the culture that we are used to in the United States and in most of the developed world. Across the world, the idea of a strong work ethic is extremely prevalent. In Japan, for instance, the culture is so industrious and fixated on production and results that Japan has one of the highest rates for mental illness among any country of its relative economic prosperity. In "Walden", Thoreau takes a dive into how these two ideas are correlated. He argues that because many people have such high expectations about their life's purpose or meaning, they are often unable to enjoy the simpler luxuries of everyday life. He uses the example of a farmer who inherits a large plot and spends much of their day working the land to make it fertile and productive. While this farmer might be able to produce more goods than a farmer with a small plot, they end up spending more of their time trapped doing things they won't necessarily enjoy or be happy with. By stripping down the things we do not need in life, Thoreau argues that we can reach a point of happiness where we can be content with fewer things and enjoy what we have more.
<br><br>

Another part of the text that I found especially interesting was the section where he addressed clothing and its purpose in the modern world. Although times have changed an immense amount since Walden's original conception, I think that many of the points that Thoreau makes about fashion and clothing are very prevalent. He argues that we put too much value and importance on the clothing that we wear, and not only does it require more effort, but it brings many negative side effects such as social stratification. Without the notion that some clothes look better than others, we would be less inclined to judge people and waste time, money, and human resources on producing items that wouldn't exist without the fashion industry.
<br><br>

Henry David Thoreau is an iconic historical figure in many contexts. His classic work "Civil Disobedience" is yet another example of how a classic text has powerful messages that shine through into today's turbulent times. While "Civil Disobedience" is a far more political text than "Walden", they share a number of similarities in the way that Thoreau approaches the problems he seems abundant in the world surrounding us. The ideas that Thoreau presents in Walden are important to both the environmental movement and any social movement seeking to cut down on excess consumption and waste.

I agree with a lot of the points you make in your first paragraph. I really liked your use of Japanese work culture as an example of the great value society places on a strong work ethic. What intrigues me the most about the problem in Japan is that a lot of the time, workers in Japan work as long as they do because they feel obligated to do so, even if they are not being productive. I'd argue that humans cannot be completely productive for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week; it's simply unsustainable for the average person. It's almost eerie to me that many of Thoreau's points, in this case, that most people work too hard, still resonate today, some even more so than ever before. 
<br><br>

Another important point made by Thoreau that you highlighted, that "because many people have such high expectations about their life's purpose or meaning, they are often unable to enjoy the simpler luxuries of everyday life," is one that I can very much relate to, but also realize that not many people, myself included, actively or even occasionally think about. I constantly overwhelm myself with a variety of tasks, all ones that I think I subconsciously value as essential to my life purpose, but in reality and very much ironically, only make my life harder. Every person could take some time out of their day to value the small things in their lives that bring them joy or satisfaction, but many people don't stop to cherish their current situation, to be present. 
<br><br>


One point that I do disagree with to some extent, however, is the point made by Thoreau regarding fashion that you referenced, "he argues that we put too much value and importance on the clothing that we wear, and not only does it require more effort, but it brings many negative side effects such as social stratification." I think fast fashion is absolutely horrendous, both for your wallet and for the environment, and I also believe it very much fits Thoreau's perception of clothing. However, I think timeless fashion, articles of clothing that never go out of style and that look good on you personally, break Thoreau's mold simply because timeless fashion is amazing for the environment so long as one buys clothing that will last, but it also should make you feel better about yourself as a person rather than appease those around you; if people compliment you regarding your fashion sense, great, but at the end of the day, as Thoreau so perfectly articulates, "public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion.”

There is a clear reason why Walden is still held to be one of the most influential environmental and philosophical texts, and Thoreau’s extensive explanations of the pitfalls of our consumption habits in this chapter alone makes the sad reality of our “scripted” lives all too clear. Throughout the first chapter, he relates the advancements of his society and modernity (as Ken discussed regarding the rise of fast fashion during the era that Thoreau was writing this book) to the mechanized performances of a complex machine. He speaks of the load that man must carry with him constantly, stating that,”the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.” In these few lines, Thoreau manages to summarize the plight of modern consumerism for the individual. We, in effect, give up our lives to a preplanned series of tasks. Work so you can buy, buy so you can be happy. Always working, never finding happiness. 
<br><br>


To that point, I think there is a great deal to be said for separating one’s self from all of the pressures, requirements and expectations of everyday society to get back in touch with nature and figure out what is really necessary to live a happy, healthy life. I myself try to take strides to this end on a regular basis and have to date adopted veganism, begun thrifting about 50% of my clothing, walking everywhere that I can, and countless other small actions. Even these efforts though are not enough to remove us from the script which has been handed to us. It will take a complete separation from the current mode of consumerism in order to come to a place where we can maintain both harmony within ourselves, but also with the earth.

I was a Boy Scout before and reading Thoreau's "Walden" and it is possible to live the life he talked about. He lived on neccessities such as food, shelter, clothing, and fire. On the other hand, this man lived in the 19th century. There were almost no factories and other industries polluting our planet. This is the 21st century and I do not know how long people are going to be living in the countryside. Surely, we are going to still have smartphones because items like that make our life easier. I am most likely looking at this the wrong way. As I continue to write, I am doubting that Thoreau wants to live in the countryside but think about what is important for our environment. The rich also have these neccessitites but they have way much more than the rest of us combined. I think higher taxation on those at the top would be a great start.

OKAY, so as much as I would like to reminisce my days back in AP Lit when I had to use speech 100, it was difficult to read to say the least. Don’t get me wrong I like to read complex literature as much as the next guy but when we are talking about an issue as simple as cutting down on the shit you don’t need I don’t think you it’s necessary to have all this “elevated” diction, right? I mean Walden says it in the beginning when he states this writing  was for the poor, like what? I don’t think poor people want to be given a whole ass lecture on why being poor is not so bad but used in a watered down double speak. But I get the general premises, we need to be more conscious on the amounts of things we have. You don't need that fourth Gucci belt, like there goes a pay check for food. It's not about the amount of things we have but about the amount of crap we don't need. This brings me to a comment I had made to a documentary from the Before the Flood, how I had a small discussion with my roommate and how she basically “if other people are going to enjoy stuff like that [luxuries] then so can I” and “well we're going to die anyway”. We certainly don't need luxuries to survive, so was my roommate's response out of retaliation for calling her out, questioning the only ways she is used to and thus feeling threatened, or it conditioned to the point of rejecting the idea that changing your life style for the environment does not compare to the individuals life. Ultimately, I cannot speak for her so I will only say this, not caring about your negative footprint on the world is a privileged and clout chasing thing to say when you keep in mind all the flora and fauna, and poor communities will pay the price of their lives from the damage you have caused and it's just so easy to continue to play into our "roles" because capitalism has systemically ingrained non-sustainable living.

The theme I got for this week's readings, video, and film was minimalism and its core benefits. This is clearly evident in Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden '' because he discusses the idea of living a simpler life. The conventional life that most lived at that was clearly not for Thoreau. The fact that he did not want to live like everyone else is clearly evident in the line “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.” He's not like most men and wants to be different but also lead those astray to form a better society. The way to escape the desperation that engulfed everyday joes was to live a simpler life and follow instincts. This idea was rooted behind the thought that imperialism was a multifaceted issue that was the root of many problems. Although this text is from a much different time period it can just as easily apply our current way of life. We are too worried about whether we could buy all we could when we never thought if we should. Thoreau is teaching is a lesson that I will definitely think about and hopefully more people take note of what he truly means and stray away from the materialistic point of view that is destroying us.

In "Walden" by Henry David Thoureau, the author describes a minimalist life he experienced, while also criticizing consumerism. It reminds me of my experience. There was a time when I pursued fashionable clothes and shoes because they looked cool and everyone bought them. I even want to buy some luxury goods, even if they are expensive and if I buy these things my expenses will exceed my monthly budget. After a while I came to my senses and thought I was stupid. I only have a small amount of money. I also need to buy food and other necessities. I also want to save money for my favorite laptop. But I want to spend my money on things I don’t really like. People should always know what they really need, which is not only good for themselves, but also for the world's resource conservation.

“Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.” This quote stood out to me because it shows how even in a free, indulgent country, people still won’t have happiness.  In this quote Thoreau is trying to explain that people are so worried about work and success that they forget to enjoy life. I feel as though Henry Thoreau was trying to find what purpose simple living will serve, and if living a simpler life could lead to a more fruitful one. He practices simple living in order to see what life would be life without all the factitious cares and coarse labors. It’s an interesting thought, how much better would life be if we worried less about consumption and monetary gain? Can we not be truly happy if all we search for are things in order to deem our success?
<br><br>

Through Henry Thoreau’s two month, two week, and two day stay near Walden pond in Massachusetts, his goal was to see if he could understand society more through personal growth and introspection that he would find in the woods. 
<br><br>

I think Thoreau would be appalled with 20th century life. This generation is the worst with unnecessary addiction and consumption. We value minimalism less than ever. I also believe he would be ashamed of the conformity we have had to medias ideas of what a ‘happy’ life is. Our society is trying to prove our happiness through the amount of things we own and how many people approve of our life style. This ideology with consumption to achieve a fulfilling life goes against Thoreau’s whole philosophy. He would prefer more introspection of self and thoughtful connections to achieve this happiness, however the 20th century is not following that lifestyle.

I first see Thoreau solely as an innovative writer in the genre of the “stream of consciousness”. While my perception changed at this time when I reflect on the actual content of his thoughts on our lifestyle and the human-nature interaction. He is definitely also an innovative thinker the time-- it is astonishing for him to have such a clear and “unconventional” mindset at a time when the material world just started to explode. His own lifestyle was truly pioneering and innovative even till now. As our world gets more materialistic, there would be even fewer people who are willing to “sacrifice” and descend from the world of materials. Thoreau’s thoughts on the true philosophers are particularly appealing for me as most of the great thinkers throughout history in various cultures are those who practice their ways of life simply and unadornedly. That makes me think of the so-called thinkers or environmentalists who themselves engage in business that may be detrimental to our climate. As well as those who deny the scientific facts on the anthropogenic climate crisis. Their ways of life are way more extravagant and unpractical according to their own speech. 

<br><br>

While this chapter is on the economy, Thoreau definitely talks about the culture and mindsets of people. The distinction and perplexing between necessities and luxury is also something that worth noticing. As we are getting used to the consumer culture surrounding our everyday life, the distinction between luxury and necessity, between what we really need and what we think we need becomes blurry. This is the time when we really need to consider the nature of our desire and the external forces that fosters our desire which could place us and our planet earth in a dangerous situation.

As mentioned during the in person lecture that occurred earlier last week, I too was confused as to why Thoureau's work was brought forth as a topic of study in this class. I had read about his thoughts regarding the civil rights movement and he always struck me as a coddled activist within that realm. He underwent one night in jail and felt as though it was enough to write a paper on civil disobedience. However, watching Ken's video emphasizing how Thoureau dissociated from the modern world and truly became somebody who thrives through the earth, it was very inspiring towards the theory of simplicity. I harbor a newfound respect for Thoureau for thinking ahead of his time, however unfortunate it might be that his vision and thoughts were a little late in the game for us. I think Ken hits the point right on its head why he says that it's overwhelmingly impossible to stray away from these strong values of consumerism. Coming from the Bay Area, I see start ups being created every other day, hell my dad even has a job managing one. It's difficult to implement simplicity within our routines. It's integral to use Google Classroom in high schools, it's important to take CollegeBoard SAT Subject tests with over 800 pages attached to any one booklet, and it's very important to go to a great college, regardless of how far it might be. These values are ingrained in even our education, to the point where it makes it impossible to even slightly stray from a terribly abusive relationship with the planet. 
<br><br>


When Thoureau wrote, "I am sure that there is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience," it truly hit me where it hurts because my family commonly does assess the standard of a person by these qualities. The materialistic society has become a force that will continue to trump the intentions of those who want to eradicate the climate crisis, and sometimes it feels almost hopeless to think that much of anything will change in society. However, this talk of a materialistic system also brings a sliver of hope with us, since thrifting, and sustainable brands like ThreadUp and Reformation are becoming trendy through our generation. While we can't completely disassociate from the education system as a whole, it's nice to know that we still have control over certain parts of our carbon footprint.

As someone really interested in and attempting to practice a minimalist lifestyle myself, I thought I would really enjoy Walden, and that it would only deepen my belief in the virtues of living a simplistic life. However, I found myself only agreeing with the narrator’s arguments on a basic level. Maybe I was misinterpreting the text because of its poetic tone, but I found the speaker really unlikable and kind of pretentious. Sure, he found a sense of enlightenment and freedom by letting go of material luxuries, but he is extremely harsh on those who don’t share his view. Take the way he speaks about older generations as an example: “Practically, the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such miserable failures… I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors.” I believe that it’s important to take the traditions, instructions, and advice of older generations with a hefty grain of salt, because progress does not come without some level of rejection of old ideas and beliefs, but the way the narrator speaks about people who are not himself is off putting. It certainly makes me wary of bias and extremeness within his advice. 
<br><br>
 Nevertheless, I believe the message of this first chapter is important. Our parents ingrain in us a feeling of needing more in our lives, “more” being everything from food to clothing to square footage to absolutely useless knick-knacks piling up in our already-large homes. This feeling was most likely instilled in our parents by their parents, and them their parents, and so on. Walden shows that it’s not only beneficial but necessary to break the cycle of “more.” By living simply, we spare Earth’s resources, we spare our own money and time, and we spare the often unacknowledged weight of owning belongings. We don’t all have to live by ourselves in a tiny cabin like Thoreau to achieve these benefits, but by taking the aspects of a simpler lifestyle that work for you, everyone can have an impact on their own lives and on the planet.

I find this reading particularly interesting in the fact Thoreau has such ideals and ways of how everyone else should live with such strong passion and writing. It’s relatively compelling how he has these thoughts and actually implements them in his own life and lives this way for a time being. I do find it relatively hypocritical though how he does do this, but only for the short time of about 2 1/2 years. My thoughts on Thoreau aren’t very positive simply because he was only able to do this for a short period of time. People that are less adamant about the idea of living in a small box in the woods would in turn not do so because they realized he couldn’t last out there himself even being that he held these strong ideals so closely and intensely. He makes this idea of nature almost religion like and beautifully portrayed to channel the essence of life in the woods. Again, Thoreau’s ideas are intelligent and eventually would help the environment in the long run, but obviously aren’t sustainable to most people’s living habits or lives. Changing this way of living would take extreme measures for most and in turn I believe aren’t a reality.

I recognized the name "Henry David Thoureau" from a famous minimalist that went by the name of Alexander Supertramp. Alexander was also a minimalist as how Thoureau was getting at. What Thoureau was portraying was a simple lifestyle, without any of the extras. He states a bunch of topics that can easily be applied in today's world. He mentioned "consumerism", something that has plagued our society and ultimately leads to a climate crisis. Just last week we talked about how purchasing new clothes frequently is adding to our carbon footprint, a trend that was mentioned by Thoureau, "We don garment after garment, as if we grew like exogenous plants by addition without." He also mentioned how we want something new every time, how we are ignoring the basic necessities that we actually need. As aforementioned, this is very empowering because the ideas have been out for the longest, yet we haven't made much advancement to fulfill them.

Works like Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden” are special in the sense that pieces like this feel so timeless. After encountering and reading this piece again and again, I realize and comprehend more details Thoreau touches upon. Thoreau’s work is progressive in the way that it’s applicable to our time period despite having being written in 1854. 
<br><br>

It still continues to shock me ever time how ahead of his time Thoreau’s thinking was. Simplicity and minimalism was already so important to Thoreau’s life during his time, it makes me think how he’d feel if he saw how the average American lives today. For example, I would love to see his reaction to fast fashion and the seasonal fashion trends of today. This is something that has always drawn me, (being someone who loves fashion and self expression) Thoreau has an important point: we don’t need fashion.
<br><br>

All in all, I really respect his mindset towards life, it most definitely takes a lot of guy and passion to not only publish this piece during his time, but to also expose and critique the standard way of life.

<p>
Alright, I scrolled down a dozen comments, and I'm not seeing it, so here goes. Thoreau was a mean, racist person, even compared to the racism and meanness of his time. His arguments are pretentious and privileged, and he constantly undermines himself by swerving into flaccid tangents. I barely caught a glimpse of transcendentalism through his fat, glaring ego. 
<br><br>


Consider the whole paragraph dedicated to shaming the poorer residents of his area, and claiming they want to remain poor "There are those who have used all their arts to persuade me to undertake the support of some poor family in the town; and if I had nothing to do--for the devil finds employment for the idle--I might try my hand at some such pastime as that. However, when I have thought to indulge myself in this respect...and have even ventured so far as to make them the offer, they have one and all unhesitatingly preferred to remain poor." 
<br><br>


The blatant racism and prejudice aside, Thoreau just wasn't a good or kind person. I read the section three times through, because the metaphor was so thick with Greek mythology and generally dense language, but I think the argument was essentially "being great is better than being good or helping others". (This is in the final paragraphs of the chapter before the poem).  
<br><br>


Thoreau essentially argues against specialization of labor (in the "Cambridge" section). It's a valid argument, but also a privileged one. Without specialization there are no doctors, there is no government, there is no education. There is no way for sick or elderly people to receive support. Sure, if you're a healthy man in your late twenties, there's nothing to stop you from tearing down a family's house and paying 6 times its cost to build a new one, but someone with dependents isn't going to be able to make that leap. 
<br><br>


Thoreau makes some decent points. Fast fashion is unnecessary and gross, we have extraneous things that are just stressing us out, and if we take more time to relish in our living, I think we'd all be happier. I think I'd care a lot more however, about the perspective of a modern minimalist who genuinely cares about people.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this first chapter and mainly because of how ahead if it’s mind it truly was. I think what makes me truly sad is that because of the time he was making writing this then published it, people most likely thought him a mad man or extremist who didn’t know what he was talking about. The truth however, is that if there had been more people who believed in the way of simple-living as much as Thoreau did, I’m sure we wouldn’t be in nearly as much of a dangerous predicament as we are right now. His telling of how truly meaningless the life of most people he watches are, you almost have a realization yourself, or at least for me I did. I was reminded that we so often have such a “work” and “success” mentality where all we’re focused on is how far can we get and how much can we earn that we don’t look at anything outside of ourselves. 
<br><br>

Thoreau stated something that I connected to the climate change movement that we’re going through right now. Thoreau said “What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather indicates, his fate.” The reason this stuck to me so strongly is because it was such a true statement and reflection of the exact mentality we have now nearly two centuries later. I mean, nearly two centuries?? And we still can’t realize that because of our hyper focus on ourselves we’re destroying our future and deciding our “fate” as Thoreau said. This fate we’re making is one filled with the destruction of this planet.

After reading "Walden" by Henry David Thoreau's, I went on a minimalism marathon on YouTube. I watched multiple videos of people who were actually informed on the concept and those who just did it for the aesthetics and trend.  Regardless of why they are doing it, this trend is helping cut back on carbon emissions just by deciding to not buy a bundle of clothing and more. He uses a quote that is used to express a negative social concept, "monkeys following the lead money," but I believe we can also see this idea in a positive light. Just like many of these influencers are only following a "trend" as a lifestyle, they can persuade all of their followers to do the same. Although it may seem superficial at first, it can grow into an actual understanding of how consumerism works. 
<br><br>


A perfect example of this "trend" is the famous Marie Kondo method, she used a quote that spread like wildfire throughout social media, "if it doesn't spark joy, get rid of it." This prompted a whole movement to donate and recycle clothes and goods, while also being conscious to buy things you are absolutely sure you'll use for a long time. The youth and popular masses are still not environmentally conscious, but they will follow social movements, as they do not want to be left out. So like Thoreau said, society really is about monkey see, monkey do.

<p>
Honestly, at first I found this text quite confusing, I kept questioning what was his point. Eventually, it became clear to me that he was trying to promote this lifestyle of simplicity. The text seemed philosophical at times, he wouldn’t directly state things. There’s still some of his points that I struggle with the full meaning of some of his ideas. For instance, when he talks about the idea that men labor under a mistake and that they are employed by necessity. Under a mistake? What does he exactly mean by this? I think his writing also shows subtle meanings about our society and how we interact with each other, as well as how we should interact with each other according to Walden. For instance, Walden explains how the finest qualities of our nature can only be preserved by the most delicate handling, but we don’t treat ourselves nor others tenderly. Walden was trying to tell us that we need to be more tender with ourselves and others. In other words, we need to be more empathic, more compassionate because if we aren’t we let go of the best parts of who we are as humans. I thought it was interesting when Walden brought up the idea of poor people and promising to pay. I specifically liked it when we said that people promise to pay tomorrow, but die today. This could be a criticism of how we never truly fall through our promises. In my head, it made me think of the climate crisis, how we make these promises to do better by the planet, but when push comes to shove and when we are having to sacrifice, we don’t follow through our promises. Another idea that Walden brings up that intrigued me was when he mentioned how a man thinks of himself determines his fate. This idea also reminded me of the climate crisis, but instead of a man of his fate, all of us and our fate. If the older generation thinks of themselves as the blame of this climate crisis, maybe more of them will help create change and alter the fate of all of us and those who are yet to come. 
    <br><br>
               Another idea that I liked of his was when he mentioned that there could be the same item for different people and one might see it as a necessity, another might see it as a luxury, and another it could be entirely unknown. He goes on to mention that the people who see it as a necessity are helpless and diseased. I feel as though he was trying to convey to us that the people who see unnecessary things as necessities are helpless until they change this point of view. Once they realize it’s not a necessity, we can all move forward. Walden speaks mainly to “the mass of men who are discontented,” meaning he’s trying to reach those who no matter what they have end up in dissatisfaction. This idea reminds me of the documentary this week about minimalism. We know that no matter how much a person gets, they end up in this state of dissatisfaction, discontent because there’s always this idea of wanting more or believing that you need more.

When reading the first chapter of “Walden” by Henry David Thoreau, it was a big shock and eye-opener due to the fact that he was talking about a “minimalistic” lifestyle extremely early in United States history. Due to the fact that everything scientific and technological has advanced extremely fast within the past couple of decades, within my mind, it seems that back in the 18th hundreds and 19th hundreds, everything was extremely simple already and less environmentally damaging than how things are now. It puts up the question of “Do I really need this?” within the listeners or readers' mind and realistically, a lot of the time, many things are purely for pleasure rather than necessity. Thoreau’s argument that we should be living a lifestyle with only necessities is something that I definitely agree with and I believe it would really help us with limiting the negative consequences that occur. Creating a lifestyle that would sustain humans, alongside keeping the environment in a stable condition is something that I truly believe will benefit both us and the earth. I believe that his reaction to our 21st-century world would be one of disappointment. If he had to create a warning statement for people back in the late 18 hundreds, I believe that he expected things to proceed to get worse, hoping that people would listen to his advice, but expecting the worst.

Walden written by Thoreau is an autobiography that introduces his frugal life beside the Walden Pond. Basically, Thoreau want to tell his readers that the great people, especially the great philosophers, are the people who own the highest spiritual wealth. At the same time, tempering themselves by owning as few material property as possible like Confucius in China. In the chapter one, he hoped to prove that frugal lifestyle can effectively help people gain the progress on their spirit. Of course on the contrary, excessive wealth made people lose their minds and immerse in the joy of money and wants, which will prevent people from the moral progress.

Thoreau gives me a feeling that he is a part of the forest beside the Walden. He lived in the forest for two years, and then went back to the civilized world. He is free and always keeps his own independence and advancement, which also means that he did not care much about others. It makes me feel that he pursued the acme of spirit through an extreme way. Isolation, loneliness, hard environment, all of these can destroy one person. For me, I believed that people are social animals, and we need care and company.
    <br><br>
Once he mentioned in the book that a young man hoped to have the same lifestyle as Thoreau, but Thoreau said that he does not want people follow him and live the same as him. He thought each person in the world has their own uniqueness, and each person can find their fit lifestyle prudently and carefully. Though I do not agree with Thoreau in some ways, I think this idea is really enlightening. We live for ourselves and be a better being.

Henry David Thoreau's, "Walden" it was somewhat lengthy and I did get bored, but something powerful about this piece was how he drifted away from the status quo and began to think deeply about the human species and really analyze how as a society there was a continuous cycle that resulted in a demented form of functioning as a whole. People always strive for more instead of appreciating the necessities, people pursue more as a form of happiness but usually are left feeling more empty as that initial rush of euphoria will fade away. People are desperate to feel happy and to even fit in at times so what they're willing to do misguides them from feeling truly at their best. Thoreau lived his best life in a sense which is great for him, but he needs to acknowledge his privilege in being able to do so because in some cases it's really not that simple for some folks. It would be nice to be able to work as it can be draining, but to see it as a form of enslavement is quite drastic considering the circumstances regarding slavery around that time and being means there's no choice, abuse, and being denied basics rights as a human being. Overall it felt like he was dragging things on and if he wanted to reach a wider audience he would make clear, concise points because at times he was confusing. Although as a "youngish" man I do applaud him for his attempt in searching for purpose and meaningful life.

In the first chapter, “Economy”, of Henry David Thoreau’s masterpiece “Walden”, he describes the self-sufficient life that he was living alone back in the days when he was next to the lakeside of Walden and narrates his story and relationships with his neighbors and farmers. From the first glance at his book, I feel like Walden is a free land where the ideal of freedom lives and everybody is away from the capital-dominated socialization. Fortunately, I studied the course of Zen Buddhism last quarter, and I could see some of the Taoist doctrines reflected upon Thoreau’s book: his life in Walden makes himself contented in poverty, devoted to things that are spiritual, and withdrew from the modern society. Connecting with today’s world and those environmental problems generated by human’s highly modernized activities, Thoreau’s idea sort of explains the potential direction that we could follow to mitigate our climate crisis and even eliminate it.

    <br><br>

Furthermore, from his conversations and experiences with farmers, Thoreau understands how hard their lives are and critiques the lavish life that the wealthy live. I was totally impressed by his idea: “the majority of the luxurious goods and those so-called comfortability are not only unnecessary but also detrimental to the progress of mankind”. How much better could our world get if everybody considers this even a little bit while doing their own things?

I find it so intriguing that the ideas of minimalism can be traced so far back to Thoreau's "Walden". Throughout the chapter you assigned to us, Thoreau goes on and on about the negative effects of emerging capitalism, and how he finds that the more he works, the more he finds himself "keeping up with the joneses". This constant struggle of having to keep up appearances is a main driving factor of climate change and why it is so hard for most people to make environmentally conscious decisions. People have to have the nicest and trendiest clothes, or the biggest house, or the largest car, and work themselves to death to have this lifestyle. But it is unnecessary. Thoreau states that he can provide everything he needs for himself by working 40 days out of the year, and that he is generally happier to spend his time pursuing knowledge instead of working for these lavish luxuries. Strangely enough, his statement still holds up today. A recent study at Princeton discovered that a person's happiness IS linked to the amount of money a person earns, BUT only up to a national average of 75,000 dollars a year. While this number is still quite large, it goes to show that a person is happiest when they do not have to worry about necessities (food, shelter, water) and still have enough time and money to spend on things they care about.
    <br><br>

I also find it intriguing that Thoreau is adamant against the idea that his lifestyle at Walden Pond is the ideal way everyone should live (" I would not have any one adopt my mode of living...I would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way.."). Through his writing he grants his readers the ability to follow in his footsteps, but also acknowledges the extremity of his lifestyle. This one statement has altered my perspective on "Walden", and makes me want to give it a second read to see if I can learn anything different this time around.

While reading Thoreau's "Walden" I was very skeptical of how far a book from the 19th century would be applicable to modern-day life, and it was surprising to see that even a text written over 100 years ago is so socially relevant. Maybe it says something about the continuity of human growth and ever-increasing demand for more and bigger but when he stated that "it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left." it really struck me. The first part of this quote is very true, especially in today's society where most people choose to disregard climate change and their own carbon footprint because of their "common mode of living" is familiar to them. However, depending on how you interpret the second part, it can be also true, if we look at it as people not seeing any other choice left, possibly because of some media's portrayal of the desperate and inescapable effects of climate change. In a way, I could understand how the situation seems too intimidating that they believe nothing they can do will stop it, but it's an easy out. 
    <br><br>


Through Thoreau's experiment in living as simply as possible, he questions the need for a materialistic culture built off of excess, one that has been amplified since his time, and I think it's very much a "coming of age" text in which people are now trying to live by values he presents within the work to combat the climate crisis. Overall, Walden is a book I think everyone can and should metaphorically take a page from, for themselves and the planet.

In the reading, Thoreau’s Walden advocates for a simpler lifestyle, the minimalism, which is an environmental friendly, innovative lifestyle. He simplified his life to a most simplified form by not buying or using luxuries and unnecessary item, such as expensive clothes, meat like pork, and large house. He hold disagreement to the consumerism who were desire to own more unnecessary goods. Those person were keen on buying latest or unnecessary products to satisfy their spirits need.
    <br><br>
I agree with the minimalism and i think i am actually following the minimalism in my daily life. I always buy things that meet my basic need and most fit me instead of buying various products to try. Like makeup products, i always buy products that i’m familiar with since i know this products suits me very well and this avoids spending unnecessary money and even harm on my skin. I only buy clothes with high quality and i always control myself from buying more new clothes especially fast fashion clothes and expensive brand clothes. Of course the main reason is that i don’t want to waste money on unnecessary clothes and its also because of the film “Merchants of Doubt” i saw which introduce the negative impact the fast fashion industry bring to the environment and people. Usually i would like to eat more vegetable and fruit instead of meat. Especially when i got to know eating less meat is a kind of environment-friendly  action. This also make me physically healthier and make my skin better. As in my campus, most of the students who live in campus live in a share room with share bathroom and kitchen. As for me, i live in a triple room. I think this can be a kind of minimalism action as we save unnecessary space.

In this reading, Thoreau describes his simplistic lifestyle choices while criticizing the societal norms concerning material wealth. Like the video mentions, he details how past generations have set up a culture in which consumerism is ideal and ingrained in the mindsets of most people. For one, he discusses the desire for large homes in cities which, for most, can only be afforded by the way of working to pay it off eventually. Yet, people who live in those homes would be perceived as well off, so much as someone who fully owns a humble shelter, so people will continue trying to attain unnecessarily extravagant houses. I would have to agree that it does not seem wise to live in a larger house than one can afford, with space that will mostly be of no use, in order to live what is generally seen as a richer lifestyle. This sacrifice of additional money, time, and effort does not seem worth it when there are alternatives that are sufficient for survival, and may lead to the same net level of satisfaction with all things considered. Also, he talks about the problematic nature of clothing once it becomes more than an item to retain heat. Clothing, as deemed by society, represents one’s rank within civilization, the slight alterations in clothing that makes it seem more fashionable which leads to unnecessary consumption, the factory system serves to only benefit corporations, and, in general, the replacement of slightly worn clothes for newer versions. When he talks about how clothes with patches are unacceptable to wear in public, it makes me think about how ripped jeans have been a relatively recent fashionable item, but even then, these rips were all manufactured and, like other modern fashion trends, is quickly replaced with some other product that leads to more consumerism. Additionally, I found the example, where he states, “A man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a new suit to do it in” quite revealing. It is interesting how society has conditioned us to expect that there should be a change in wardrobe for every new event that occurs in life, and, more generally, that an increase in consumption is the appropriate response for celebrations--not only for jobs, but also for birthdays, anniversaries, and so on.

As a philosopher, Thoreau did not express his philosophical thoughts with the obscure language usually used in classic books of philosophy. On the contrary, he used his own life practices to show the world how to live a philosopher-like life, and the simple and authentic language formed by these life practices is "Walden Lake". Thoreau emphasized that human beings should not live only for the necessities, nor for the pursuit of more necessities, but should pursue wisdom, explore self, and love life after having the proper necessities. This kind of thinking is far more important for environmental protection than a system for pollution control, because this kind of strong regulation is the best response to the current we are drowned by the ocean of desire. Only by changing the concept of consumption and improving the spiritual realm can we fundamentally solve environmental problems.

Nowadays, it is hard to imagine a life without the internet, phones or computers. But Thoreau as the author chose to live in the woods, which was isolated and only depended on his own labor. For me, it is almost impossible to live a life like this that I cannot understand or tolerate the situation that I will be isolated and live solely by myself. I need to talk and interact with my friends, and I also need to have the internet to connect with the world. Thoreau also requires every writer to account their life in a simple and sincere way, not just listening and spreading other people’s story. Thoreau considered the life under laboring due to the pursuit of necessity as the fool’s life, because people have no time to be anything but a machine for laboring. This is an interesting point because almost everyone in the world right now has a purpose of life, like a job. The things you do give you value and determine your dedication to the whole society. However, Thoreau believes that public opinions are actually not very scary, the most important thing is the private opinion towards ourselves that these views truly determine who we are and the values behind our lives. 
    <br><br>

Thoreau later defines the word “necessary of life” like food. The majority of the things in people’s daily life are not necessary and can even be considered as luxury. He introduces the idea that people should focus more on the mental side of their own lives like the pursuit of wisdom and love themselves. And at the same time, the material world is not that important to the people anymore, since they put more attention on improving themselves mentally. Then these ideas will lead to the stage where people start to waste less resources and give more back to the Earth. And it will be way more effective than just simply stopping pollution.

Rereading this text really made me appreciate how much I've grown as an individual over the past four years. My first encounter with this text was my freshman year of high school. Although I did agree with many of Thoreau's sentiments of simplification, reading it now has made me realize that I had not internalized many of the concepts he was presenting. For instance, one aspect that clashed with my younger self was that of vegetarianism. I flat out rejected that idea and did not give it much thought. Now, four years later, I am well on my way to transitioning to a plant-based diet. Whats ironic is that I didn't credit my transition to Walden, but looking back, that was my first serious invitation to vegetarianism. Additionally, what convinced me to transition was the compilation of many different sources, all presenting different upsides so, in a way, Walden did influence my decision all be it subconsciously.
    <br><br>


Its funny that you mentioned his rejection of coffee and tea in the video. His rejection of trade goods was what I actually based my freshman year final essay on. It was and still is my biggest gripe with Walden. I strongly agree with simplification, but just as over consumption is an issue, I think that oversimplification can be just as bad. Throughout the past couple of centuries, we have worked extremely hard to establish our global society. It has made our society more stable, enriched our culture and allowed for unimaginable collaborative progress in virtually every industry. If we killed trade, this system would crumble. More importantly however, we would lose all influence over the rest of the world and with it the power to teach them about simplification. Although simplification applies mostly to western culture, there are many other implications such as the transition to renewable energy and the transition to plant based diets that apply to the rest of the world. Developing countries are not going to head into this direction on their own. It is in our collective best interest to use the influence that we currently have to steer them into the right direction.
    <br><br>


Who knows, maybe I'll come back in another four years and be against imported goods, but for now I agree with my freshman self and see globalization as a way to fight the climate crisis.

To compare my property to Thoreau's “wooden tent” makes me feel guilty. To compare my actual home in square feet to Walden’s makes me feel remorseful. To compare my bedroom to Walden’s makes me feel criminal. I’m racking my brain trying to think of what modern-day America might look like if we took up Walden’s way of living. 
    <br><br>
Deep into the reading, when Thoreau talks about man and his relationship with his animals, I stopped over this quote and read it over a few times. “Man thus not only works for the animal within him but, for a symbol of this, he works for the animal without him. Though we have many substantial houses of brick or stone, the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by the degree to which the barn overshadows the house.” I translated this to the degree to which a man is said to be successful is not measured by his display of wealth and riches; for it is the proof of his hard work that defines him. This claim should be preached from the rooftops. I am sure we all know many people who need to hear this more often.

In “Walden”, Henry David Thoreau discusses the concept of simplified lifestyle and how it could be beneficial to society. Thoreau proposes that the only things that people NEED on a day to day basis are the absolute necessities: food, shelter, etc. If everyone were to adopt this simplified lifestyle in today’s world, it would be very beneficial to the well being of the planet. However, society has progressed economically, technologically, socially, and philosophically. As a result, it is very difficult for our current world to revert back to a simplified lifestyle when they have already seen and benefited from the luxuries of modern advancements. An alternative to making everyone revert back completely to a completely simplified lifestyle is to make our current lifestyle more sustainable and efficient. For example, people love to buy clothes; instead of constantly producing new clothes across the world, promote the idea of thrifting and second hand shopping. Another example would with cars: instead of reverting back to minimalistic transportation, promote the idea of electric and more fuel efficient cars. When looking at ways to improve the modern world, it is important to be realistic in order to have a chance of actually making an impact. Imposing unrealistic forms of lifestyles may be very ineffective, so instead it makes more sense to find simpler, more efficient alternatives to luxuries that are provided to today’s society.

Through Thoreau’s work, we can know that the environmental problem that we currently face has existed for a long time. Although today’s situation may become more complex, the internal reason for this issue has not changed, that is, materialism, anthropocentrism and human’s ignorance and selfishness. Since I took English 22 before, I still remember that Ken mentioned that because of some work that appreciates the nature, people’s interests towards the nature was activated and the environment was further damaged as tourism flourished. And this also proves human’s selfishness and capitalism. Also, fashion industry is another vital factor in promoting the damage of the planet. As Thoreau claimed, fashion is an extension of our incessant desire for luxury and excess. And we should also start our practices to diminish such desire and reduce the damage to the earth by selecting sustainable materials and say no to fast-fashion life style.

This is going to be Slightly Off topic and a little bit hippy-dippy, but it’s my genuine reaction to the reading. I really love this book and was pleased to see it on the reading list for this class. One of the passages I have marked in my copy at home is “The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise.” Although this is slightly off topic to this weeks semi-theme of minimalism, I think this argument is striking when used in context of climate change. It can be looked at one of two ways. One, in the common argument that the green movement is looking for problems where there are none. That we are focusing on unimportant aspects like plastic straws or plastic bottles when there are “real” issues happening all across the world. That climate activists are simply malcontents who can’t accept the progress life has made. Or 2) the lives of the deniers, who despite living in a world ready to offer them everything they need, continually fight the fight for more stuff. One might say earth itself is a paradise. It gives us food and shelter and water and air to breathe in a solar system where we could survive nowhere else. It gives us stability and a home in a universe as mysterious as it is infinite. But we can’t settle for the trees and mountains and peace that it gives us and that we can give eachother, and instead constantly are looking for something More.

After reading the first chapter of Walden, I found it admirable that he left the life he knew behind to explore an extremely minimalist one. I do find it hypocritical though, that Walden came from an affluent family and after two years, he moves back home and into civilized life. Sure, he is promoting a minimalist lifestyle, but some people do not have the same privilege as him. They live that lifestyle not by choice but because they have to, they’re poor! I feel as though he's making a mockery of the lives of the poor even if he wasn’t trying to. 
    <br><br>

Other than that, I feel that we could apply his advice to all of our lives.  A quote that stuck out to me was “The mass of men lead lives of  quiet desperation.” It’s true, we all slave away with no clear end goal in mind. Walden is right when he says the necessaries of life  for man is food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. Once we satisfy those necessities, we look for newer, better, and bigger things. People have always been too focused on obtaining more and more luxuries. Our obsession with obtaining more and more,  keeps us from truly realizing what the purpose of living is. Thoreau  criticizes how men work too hard, worrying about money, which exhausts them and degrades their lives. Often times, we forget that there is more to life than making money. We forget that we are the only ones in control of our lives, we have a choice in how we want to conduct our lives. 
    <br><br>

What Walden said about the clothing industry stays true for today’s society. The clothing industry does not want to serve people’s best interests, they are just focused on stealing our money. There’s  no reason why someone needs so many different pieces of clothing. But honestly, I might be a hypocrite for saying that because I own a lot of articles of clothing myself. But that has what society has conditioned me and everyone else to do.

In the book “Walden” the first chapter describes Henry David Theoroua and his experience in living near a small pond in Concord. In this chapter he describes how he tried to live an extremely basic existence where only the bare necessities are required. And when I say “bare necessities” I mean literally just shelter, clothes and food. While he only did this for a couple of years,, he wanted to show how living a very simplified existence is actually a beautiful thing. During this time he apparently kept a log of how much money was being spent and while he did spend a little in order to purchase bare minimum things, he also found himself receiving a small profit through farming. In total he did not spend more than 65 dollars in his time there. I think this was a pretty good read. I’ve heard of people who kind of go “off the grid” and live lives similar to this but this was the first time reading someone’s personal experience in still trying to be as sustainable as possible when doing so. Even when he mentioned how he borrowed a neighbors axe but made sure to return it sharper than before. I believe that he is completely valid in feeling somewhat “freed” by living here. While I personally have no intention to do so, I think doing this could easily bring not only a sense of gratitude but also personal fulfilment.

I think that there is something extremely romantic about the simple life Thoreau choose to live. As a kid I remember always playing Little House on the Prairie with my friends, romanticizing and idealizing the “simple way of life.” Of course as we get older we see these lifestyle choices of the clothes we wear, the size of the house we live in, and the food we eat as status symbols… but Thoreau’s choice to reject the glamor available with these specific things is very admirable. As I continue to get older (and become more educated most importantly), I actually feel like I see myself coming full circle to wanting that simple lifestyle again: the one that Thoreau discusses in Walden. This is partially out of an economic perspective, but mostly out of one of trying to become more environmentally aware and environmentally conservative. 
      <br><br>
  Walden, unknowingly lived a life that could honestly be the solution to our climate crisis should everyone choose to follow it. Of course this is unrealistic, but there are elements of the life he lived that if applied today, could have a huge impact. I think my favorite line of the reading comes from when the farmer says to him “you cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with" yet how Thoreau then goes to point out the irony of this saying how the farmer “religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle.” I appreciate the clothing choices and housing choices that Thoreau made as well, and think that these could have a large impact on our experience combating climate change today, but I can’t shake the impact that this line had on me. It goes to show how silly we are to try and convince ourselves a plant-based diet just isn’t “enough” when in reality, it is MORE than enough.

The first chapter of Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" was a bit hard to read, because of the vocabulary. But looking past this, it was very interesting and engaging and gave me some insight into today's most common way of living. He speaks of "minimalism" from what I would consider a credible point of view, since at the time he was living alone in the woods in a very small house. His criticism of the economy and those in it covers everything from slavery to clothing to farming. Even though he criticizes these things and the way most of us live now, he does it in such a way that focuses on the positives. He is saying... look how great this life will make you feel! The way Thoreau lives reminds me of what my mom talks about her dream life as. Very connected to nature, simple, and peaceful. To live both "simply and wisely," as he puts it.

After read the Chapter 1 of Walden and watched the video Prof.Ken presented to introduce this chapter, there are three most impressive sentences left in my mind. 
      <br><br>
For housing, Thoreau presented an idea that “a wooden version of single person tent with the floor just big enough for a bed roll to keep things simple from the start”. For clothing, Thoreau offered a viewpoint that the head monkey in Pais puts on a traveller's cap and all the monkey of the America do the same because every generation laughs at the old fashions. As for eating habits, Thoreau provides a belief that “I have no doubt that it is part of the destiny of the human race in its gradual improvement to leave of eating animals”. If I did not have the class of Eng23, I would not have empathy for those three sentences. Instead, that sentence would be wild for me in that is not our prime goals for nowadays are making a lot of money, living a large house and buying everything we wanted? Nevertheless, after I had four weeks class, I learnt how urgent the climate problem is and over-consumption is a way of wasting resources and increasing the emission of CO2 in that a lot of CO2 and methane will generate during the production process to accelerate the global warming effect. Thoreau called for people to live a simplistic life and give up the luxuries that we were unnecessary for us in exchange for a comfortable life. People stuck for competitive life style from one generation to another. In their concept to a successful life, one should defeat others and buy whatever they want without caring the cost of the items. They sacrifice their entire life to pursue the so-called success. Nevertheless, when they reach their culmination, they find the happiness bring by the success is temporary and the anxiety they have suffered during the pursuing process is miserable. The simple life Thoreau presented is perfectly matching the theme of minimalism. One could not count on buying stuff to fill up the void. Oppositely, he could use the spare time to do other meaningful things to fill up the spiritual void, which is a positive way not only can decrease one’s anxiety and fear of making money, but also reduce the climate problem since we will get rid of over-consumption.

After reading and digesting Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden”, and watching Ken's video, i realize they tried to help us ask ourselves for defining what are necessities and what are desires in our everyday life. This reminds me of a book i read few years ago called "Buy-ology". I was reflecting on myself since i am the person who has passion and interests in fashion. I always be the one who's following the trends, catching up with the celebrities. Then, I noticed Henry starting to introduce the concept of minimalism and the benefits of this simplest living style. I'll just take myself as an example. Honestly, I know i buy clothes or cosmetic products not because i really need them, but i know i want them. Then, i ask myself what is "i want", we all clearly know "want" is the expression of desire just like people buying luxuries to fulfill further happiness in their life. After connecting Ken's video and Henry's book, i realize most people can't help themselves differentiate what is need and what is desire. Needs are necessities for life like food, toothpaste, necessary clothes, and etc. However, when people reach their standard life, they will start to want more. It's a common sense, no right or wrong. Thing about luxuries, there are huge amounts of celebrities, athletes propaganda for the big companies like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, and etc. Some people have addictions in collecting limited edition of crocodile leather bags or fur jackets. Do they need them?? Will they die without having them? Human beings really need to reflect on themselves and thinking about what we desire is not we need for life. We couldn't sacrifice our planet to fulfill our desires. That'll be too selfish. It's the time for a change(i am speaking for myself)

While reading "Walden", it was a bit difficult to understand because of the 19th century language that was used. Once I got past that aspect of it, the idea of leading a more simplistic life became appealing to me. It is quite exhausting to be constantly working, working, working just to reach the bare necessities and even breaking the bank just to buy that "super cool" but totally unnecessary thing. A line that really stood out to me was, "I have no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out" followed by, "still living, and dying, and buried by this other's brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying today". I find myself even doing this, going out for an expensive lunch that I totally should not be wasting money on but do it anyways because it is what everyone else does. But is a $15 lunch really worth more than an hour of work at a minimum wage job when I could make something at my house for about $2? Absolutely not, but I still do it! And by the time I can afford to waste my money on some trendy piece of clothing, its already out of style! It is interesting to me that an idea of leading a more simplistic life was being proposed in 1854 because I had always thought of it as being a more modern idea. It almost saddens me because we have had this idea for over 100 years yet it is still not that popular of a lifestyle, which brings me to the quote, "the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another man must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off". I always feel like, well if I change my habits to help the climate crisis and make a difference, it won't really make a difference if not EVERYONE is doing it. But, if everyone has that mind set, there will never be change and I just need to make the change in my life style and make my own difference instead of worrying about what everyone else is doing.

With the rapid development of cities and technology, the environment is getting worse. The fresh air of the past is long gone, replaced by the exhaust of cars and the exhaust of factories. Sometimes I really want to go to the countryside alone, breathing in the fresh air we should have, and listening to the sound of nature.

What are the real necessities of one's life? Someone complained that they couldn't afford a house. Thoreau built a used cabin for $ 28. Some people can't solve the problem of food and clothing. Thoreau uses a small amount of time each week to grow crops, which can help fill the stomach and subsidize households. In fact, a person's real necessities are so few that they can be easily obtained through simple labor. Although human beings are constantly improving, the necessities of one's life have not changed. As long as the food fills the stomach, the house only needs to be inhabited. However, in real life, some people already have a three-bedroom and two-living house. In order to live more comfortably, he changed a villa and worked hard, but forgot the good things around him. Some people are slaves of money. They keep it and work for it every day. Doesn't money become a burden on him? These people make up the majority of the society. They can't satisfy their desires and want. They have been driven by desire throughout their lives, living in all kinds of hardships and misfortunes, what use are these after his death? On the contrary, put aside these fame and fortune, take off these gorgeous coats, and be a most authentic selves What's so bad about living without care?

I find it fascinating that Thoreau, having written Walden in 1854, brings up points that are still prevalent in today’s society, if not more so. He discusses the desperation of the common man to reach success through a life centered around highly materialistic goals, which is still the case today. Money and material objects are not inherent desires set in place by sheer human nature. Instead, we have been trained into believing such things will bring us happiness, which is seen as an implication of a successful life. However, Thoreau explains his own lifestyle as being one without luxury and focuses on finding satisfaction in other ways that do not revolve around material wealth. He brings up vegetarianism and his finding satisfaction through being self-sufficient, instead of being dependent on more industrial processes, such as the meat industry. He regards the clothing industry in a similar way, emphasizing that the functionality of clothing should be seen as its central selling point, instead of purchasing clothes for the style or current trends. 
      <br><br>
These ideas are obviously still problems in today’s society, as consumerism has only become more and more of an issue since Thoreau’s time. Today, we are bombarded by capitalism with constant advertisement and the promise that purchasing certain products will fix our insecurities that we have because of society itself. We are also taught to equate our personal success with material items, and these concepts are detrimental to not only our well-being as a society, but to our environment as well, due to the demands of consumerism. I doubt that Thoreau could have predicted the extent to which our consumerism has destroyed our sense of self along with our planet, but we can still use his ideas to apply to today’s society and hopefully make the changes he suggests, despite being made centuries ago.

I do think that Thoreau is onto something. In this chapter of Walden, he introduces the idea of living a simpler life. I really enjoyed the way that he criticized modern society's way of life: He didn't just say that it is bad or evil, he talked about it like it was something that was annoying that you were trying to get rid of. He called the thing that people inherited like farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools a "misfortune!" All of his earth imagery made me feel not just a revoke to the silly traditions of our culture, but a certain call to humanity and being one with the world. If you really think about it it actually makes a lot of sense. If what you truly crave is being fulfilled and at peace, then why would you not focus your energy on centering yourself and practicing being present? When you see a new thing in a store and picture yourself having it or wearing it, you're not envisioning yourself truly being satisfied...I don't think that people see a shirt and think "wow I would find my inner piece so hard in that." I know that there are many other implications to this type of thinking, particularly the environmental implications that we are focusing of for this class, but the part that really hit home for me was this concept of getting in touch with your humanity, and living for what truly makes you happy.

In this week’s reading, the first chapter of Thoreau’s Walden, Economy, Thoreau gives us his broad idea of "having less”. And I think Walden, at least the first chapter, should really be read by a majority of people living in the 21st century now. Why is that? First of all, at the beginning of this chapter, Thoreau describes his living condition, alone and hidden, away from the outside world and self-sufficient. Present day people, especially American people, pursuit bigger and more because of the “American Dream”. So Thoreau’s way of life in that two years and two months is really a contrast to what that is for people now. Assume this, you are currently living in a big two-floored mansion with a huge football-field backyard with you parents only, and in daily life you only sleep and eat, and maybe sometimes watch some TV shows. The actual areas being used are only as small as a normal apartment. Does the large amount of unused areas make you happy? I think they actually doesn’t. 
      <br><br>

Also, in this chapter, Thoreau is like doing a large scale of math,  what the true meaning of life is. Sometimes it’s better to focus more on life itself, doing simple things like a primitive human. Besides eating and sleeping, we can enjoy the sunlight, the wind and even just walking on our earth. The necessity for our body, like what Thoreau says in his book, is to keep warm. Blindly  pursuing fashion and luxury would be too “hot” for us - “they are cooked”. And modern people should really reconsider their relation with nature, and with themselves.

<p>

Regarding the first chapter of this book, I could totally understand the criticism that the narrator places on modern society. Criticism regarding capitalism has always existed since the rise of colonization, and after the American Revolution and Civil War, the pursuit for economic prosperity has been more popular than ever. It is apparent that capitalism and materialistic desire has blinded the world entirely that people start to completely ignore the consequences of their actions. Thoreau showed his readers that a person does not need much to live a perfect life, and that was around 200 years ago. It is almost impossible now for a person to re create his life due to our over dependence on technology and economic prosperity, thus, even though many read his book during the modern period, it is very unlikely that it would spawn a huge wave of people attempting to restrict their lives to basic agriculture and a simplistic life. Since the warning from Thoreau did not change society, his duty is thus taken by Mother Earth; we are suffering from severe climate change and natural disasters that forces us out of our pursuit for materials and open our eyes to reality. It is sad, but a necessary step for people realize it might be too late to undo their harmful actions. Personally, I wonder if we could ever cease or at least restrain our urge for economic prosperity since capital pursuit has been socialized and engraved into our family values, society as well as personal identity.

<p>

I think that the challenge Thoreau presents to his readers is completely feasible, not only for those who read “Walden” when it was written in the mid-nineteenth century but also for anyone who reads it today and everyone in between. Although moving out to a 150 square foot cabin near a pond and surrendering practically all of your worldly possessions is a bit radical (even for the most enthusiastic environmentalists), Thoreau’s recommendations about making lifestyle changes to benefit the environment (such as switching to a vegetarian diet or living in a smaller space) are very reasonable. A majority of Thoreau’s proposals are not as far-out as people believe them to be and can be taken up by almost anyone. These changes are not only simple and eco-friendly, Thoreau shows his readers how economically beneficial it can be to reduce your footprint and live with less stuff by providing lists of his expenditures and earnings during his experiment at Walden Pond.
      <br><br>

People who encounter “Walden” today might be tempted to read it and say “Easy for Thoreau to make all of these suggestions, he didn’t live in our century with the current state of our world!”. True, Thoreau has never lived in a world with iPhones and social media, and to be honest, he would probably be deeply overwhelmed by the grip consumerism has on our society, however, the basic needs of human beings have not changed in the last 150 years. We still eat food with our mouths and sleep at night and wear clothes to keep ourselves decent. Yes, society has changed and that has changed the values people have, but that doesn’t change the fact that most privileged people have way more stuff in their lives than necessary. Those who reject Thoreau’s suggestions don’t do so because it is impossible to go through with them, they do so because they can’t bear to stray away from the consumerist script life has handed them.

Thoureau's "Walden" is an example of someone who simplifies to the extreme by changing his motivations. By not being a consumer, or at least putting a limit on how much he wants to consume, he achieved a relative freedom from work. Aside from sometimes being a day-laborer and tending his own crops, he really has time to spend on anything he wants. I think that this change in motivation is something that most people don't think about, or at least I hadn't put much thought into before.
      <br><br>

I thought it was an interesting idea that you need very little to survive and be content, and ultimately what matters is your perspective, which is also the thing you have the most control over.




</p><hr>


<p>
In Henry David Thoreau’s, “Walden”, Thoreau emphasizes the importance of living a simple lifestyle. He criticizes America for being wasteful, forgetting the importance of being content with the bare necessities. He touches on the importance of being vegetarian, reducing carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases.
      <br><br>
A particularly compelling point he makes is when he talks about the impact that owning a few pieces of clothing can have. It got me thinking about fast fashion and how destructive it really is. It is easy to fall into the hype of buying clothes through websites that are intended to be "fast fashion." However, it is extremely wasteful and most of it ends up in landfills. Thoreau also states that "The luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot; as I implied before, they are cooked." This point is very interesting because it represents the idea that we can only go so far to be comfortable. No matter how wealthy you are, being warm is a simple process that doesn't require you to be wasteful.
      <br><br>
I believe that a minimalistic lifestyle should be more advocated in our society. Instead, we promote following the latest trends as a way to be seen as "hip" and "cool." People are wired to feel like they belong in society, encouraging them to follow what Thoreau calls the "lead monkey." 
      <br><br>


The current climate crisis must be addressed, and changing several aspects in the way we live is necessary to seeing change.

I agree in that I find the minimization of buying clothing to be especially compelling. At the beginning of this year, I went over to my friends house and saw that she had a rack of a few pieces of clothing hung spaciously. She told me she was trying to adopt a minimalist look, and that she kept her favorite pieces accessible and open for view in a simple way. I liked how it looked but didn't exactly understand the purpose behind it. This reading, along with the film we watched this week, really opened my eyes. A life of simplicity is not only an interesting look, but also incredibly impactful for the environment. Weather that be making simple but nutritious meals or not buying into fast fashion, it can be a "vibe" to follow the values of Thoreau. Although it sounds like a ridiculous comparison, I recently watched a video on Kim Kardashians house layout which she designed to look "minimalist." Maybe fashion will become about minimalism, or at least we can hope it will.

I have always loved the idea of just taking off to the woods like Thoreau in Walden. People become so consumed in our modern life with consumption and being socially acceptable, just retreating to a cabin in the woods with a single cot seems very tempting. It would certainly simplify a lot of things. Walden proves humans can really be content with very little, and that our society is only coming to take granted our daily life and that it will never be enough for anyone. 
      <br><br>


Instagram, facebook, and everything else are things I could be very happy without in my daily life, and drive much of the gross consumption and entitlement people have today. People need to return to the basics, to be grateful for the small things and appreciate their own company and the company of other's before things. I hope to own land like Thoreau and get back to the basics and away from all of this gross consumption. We need to change our definition of happiness to less things and more experiences, and return to our nature.

The statement Thoreau made in his novel “Walden” was clearly an important one. It inspired movements and leaves a powerful message about not succumbing to what society expects from us and focusing on strictly the things with meaning. It is about simplification. He criticizes consumerism and the fact that we are trained to want more. We think we need more, and we may think we are attached to so many items, but these are imaginary needs. He critiques the fashion industry and us feeding into it as consumers: them always advertising a new item or trend and us buying it to fit in or in an attempt to feel satisfied. But we’ve lost the priority which is functionality and become lost in keeping up with the newest styles and models promoting these styles. 
      <br><br>
He proves his theories by living in a 150-foot cabin on the shore of Walden pond. He strips away all the “stuff” to find meaning in his life and connects deeply with nature on this journey. Thoreau is a huge proponent of the back-to-nature lifestyle and is incredibly descriptive in his novel. He expresses the value of unmaterialistic things and discusses how caught up society is in crap. His actions inspired the idea of minimalism, a wonderful lifestyle choice which gives an individual’s life meaning without the overwhelm of this crap while simultaneously contributing to the fight against climate change. We can rewrite our role in this life, and we can make the choice to not fall into the template of the American dream. Thoreau inspires us to simplify and focus in on what truly adds value to our lives.

You make some great points here! I agree with your takeaways from Thoreau's Walden. Adding onto what you have mentioned, I have realized that in the past few years, the western society has almost split into two polarizing sides regarding its view on materialism. For example, nowadays in fashion, we have trends like shopping vintage or even thrifting that essentially acts like an anti-trend movement to the mainstream mentality of buying everything brand new. I am truthfully very excited and happy that today's youths are becoming more conscious of the climate crisis and the harms of mass consumption. Although the majority of the public probably still holds the ideology of "more is better", I feel like the younger generations will surely be the ones to bend that mentality or at least cast doubt and challenge the old way of thinking.

While reading Walden, I not only found many of his messages relevant to our modern day society but also applicable in the context of attitudes towards the climate crisis. One resonating theme prevalent throughout the book but introduced in this first chapter is the idea of living simply. This means not only living a life undistracted from the ‘noise’ of society but living a life that rejects materialism. In Walden, Thoreau believes that we should spend money as little money as possible on only what is necessary, and although I agree with a simplistic life style I believe we can instead avoid materialism by investing our money in things of intrinsic value. Moreover, on Thoreau’s beliefs of the role of work in a person’s life, I agree that work should not consume a person’s time. For most people work is necessary in order to live a normal life, however I maintain that everyone should remain cautious of the amount of time and resources they devote to work. This point on the role of how much a person should work directly relates to the lecture videos from last week speaking on how a society can be more prosperous if work hours are cut and time is evenly spent, allowing for a more balanced lifestyle. 
       <br><br>
 Another idea Thoreau touches on that I found interesting in the context of the climate crisis was how he believed society needed to reevaluate our consumption and self awareness. Continuing to invest in materialistic goods only satisfies a desire for them, not necessarily a need for them. Thoreau also touches on how our freedom is bounded by our shallow desire for these goods. If we continue to ignore how distracted and detached we have become, there will be no way to remedy the issue. We as the consumers of material goods, are presented the choice on of what we should choose to invest in. Only we can change the prevalence of materialism in our society by reevaluating what we find true value in.

Since the publishing of “Walden” over 150 years ago, it is easy to say that our society has progressed in a direction far and wide away from Thoreau’s proposition to living minimalistically, void of the conventional ways of life. His 2-year “experiment” allowed him to develop philosophies that couldn’t be more applicable and fitting than for our generation/society today. While this reading was pretty difficult to follow, there were several quotes that were very interesting takes reflecting his overarching philosophical approach. Thoreau argues, “It is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all, when you are the slave-driver of yourself.” During a time of a lot of divisiveness and political tension, he describes his proposition as one that applies to everyone in society regardless of location and background. He also expresses how the pressures of being successful [always by means of money, luxury, possessions] ultimately strips the individual from recognizing and appreciating life for its natural condition.  

       <br><br>

We have arguably never been more comfortable in our lifestyle/culture [condition] of materialism and luxury, where success and happiness fall hand in hand with how much we have and how “good” we have it. In response to “what do I make of this challenge to an overly bloated life?”, I think that it's generally disheartening that although this minimalistic approach has definitely grown since Thoreau’s work, it has not been able to break through much if any of our culture today. I think that living the same way he did for 2 years would be an incomparable experience that would allow an individual to appreciate life in its simplicity and to recognize the fault of the conventional ways of life (whether it be on its negative effects on the environment or detriment to the individual). But, the problem lies in the fact that society has been consumed, in all aspects, with a way of life almost polar opposite to minimalism and simplicity. Ken asks us to think about how Thoreau would react to our world today and I believe that he probably wouldn’t be surprised at all. Especially in his study and knowledge of American society then, he knew that our economy and culture was trending towards consumerism and is definitely a part of the reason why he chose to dive into this area.

Thoreau was ahead of his time, and knew that there was more to life than consumerism. It's crazy to see how much has changed since this was written, but the fact still stands that simplicity equals happiness. In the first chapter he is critical of the ways in which people are living their lives because it revolves around materialistic goods. I think it is important to change the ways in which we see success. Our planet is not able to take the selfishness that is currently consuming the world. We need to take action and realize that everything we see as success, is nothing but materials and goods that were sold to us to make us think that we made it. We have to change the ways we think and attribute success because having money and having all these material goods, does not automatically make people happy. It's something that I've noticed as I've grown up, that people are losing touch of what really matters. We live in a digital world, where often times we are consumed by things that don't even matter like followers, and likes. However, when we live our lives in ways that are not true to ourselves we become depressed and thus seek validation and contentment from materialistic goods. The only reason that it does bring joy is the fact that we are able to show off what our hard work has gotten us. I've worked a job that brought me misery but the money was good and so I continued working there, but nothing made me feel truly free like getting out of there and spending time with the people I loved most. When we do not live our lives simplistically, we lose sight of what really matters and strive for what we think will matter. Something to live by is, what do you want to be remembered for when you're gone? For me personally, I want to be remembered for my character and the way I made a difference in this world. I do not care to keep up with trends and to be liked for the way I look or present myself, but I want to be genuine to myself and appreciate the world while also making Earth habitable for future generations.

After reading the first chapter of Henry David Thoreau's book, "Walden", it became clear to me that people have a long history of associating materialistic wants with happiness. Since people commonly associate materialistic tendencies with the post-industrialized world, I was intrigued to read about Thoreau's opinion on this topic. Throughout the first chapter, Thoreau criticizes people for their general tendency to feed into the the materialistic economy. Thoreau proceeds to argue that many people mistakenly place value on items that are not necessarily the direct source of their happiness. At the beginning of the chapter, Thoreau addresses that many people have asked him questions about his lifestyle, which shows that to many, the though of doing away with unnecessary items was not a common practice. 
       <br><br>
Thoreau's telling story about living a minimalist life is effective. Rather than focusing on giving the reader a guide on how to achieve this type of lifestyle, he makes it clear that it is achievable and serves as the prototype. I believe reading this piece served as an eye-opener in an age of high consumption and fast fashion. People are constantly buying items based on aesthetic value, rather than for necessity and quality. I truly believe that many younger adults (sometimes myself included) are more worried about buying clothing that is trendy rather than made sustainably. Unfortunately, the low cost of low quality yet trendy goods places into the feedback loop that enables the consumer to buy more and more. I believe that more brands should do their part to offer sustainable clothing or clothing donation programs to encourage consumers to be more mindful when buying clothes.



</p><hr>


<p>
In this chapter of Walden,  Thoreau says two quotes that stick out to me as very interesting, and very relevant today. The first is “Yet I am sure that there is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience” and the second is “It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon.”
       <br><br>
Both of these quotes speak on how important we find appearance, and the gaze of others. Although ripped pants are currently in and fashionable, the metaphor still holds. Most people do not want to be perceived by society as poor, so they do not want dirty old looking clothing. These quotes made me think of fast fashion in our modern society. This is taking the quote very literally, but I do think Thoreau means it literally as well as figuratively. We as a society are so into novelty and appearance, that we will buy from stores like forever 21, and H&M to have the latest trends, despite the fact that these brands exploit people around the world, having workers work and disgustingly low wages, and that each piece of clothing takes so many resources to be made, and often are made of plastics that will never break down.

I have always been imagining what life would be without the so-called necessities of life and live only with what Thoreau considered basic: food, shelter, clothing and fire. It is cool to live near a pond and minimize the resources we take from nature and I like this idea. But for how long? I have this constant worry that in the future I will sacrifice my health to get what is considered that a successful person should have. Are those necessary? No, of course not. But here is the problem, we are not simply living on Earth, we are also living within a society in which have people like us who are eager to save our home and those who just cannot be satisfied with the scare resources remaining. Jeff Bezos and I are both living with food, shelter and clothing, but will I be satisfied when I see his material life is much better? Probably not. Will my voice weigh as much as him in a society? I think it's a no. Being a activist to voice for our future and the planet we're living on is relatively simple. To challenge and change living habit that was long established for centuries is hard and to be honest I am not optimistic about this.




</p><hr>


<p>
The quote that stood out the most to me in Chapter 1 of Thoreau's "Walden" was "Undoubtedly the very tedium and ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety and the joys of life are as old as Adam." Thoreau is arguing that the dissatisfaction his generation feels is something that has existed since the birth of mankind, and surely, he expected that to continue to future generations if lifestyles and value did not change . He would be correct, as unhappiness is seen everywhere today and I would venture to say that most people on Earth struggle with finding joy and meaning in their lives. Does anyone know the secret to being happy? Thoreau says it is to simplify and have less. I definitely agree that the desire for more and more is a constant insatiable fight that leaves people miserable and the planet damaged. I find it interesting that Ken connects this to the metaphor of being in a play and acting your role. I really appreciate that Ken addressed and understands the societal pressure on people, including his students, to live the way they are expected to. It made me think of how guilty I would feel to tell my parents one day that I want to live in a "tiny house" and practice sustainable lifestyles. Or that I don't eat meat anymore and therefore can't eat my mom's cooking or celebrate/have family time over foods that they enjoy and consider luxurious or special. They have given everything for my future, for my success in the hopes that I will be happy. To them, happiness looks like a big house and nice things that they never had: and it is extremely difficult to explain to them that maybe I don't need or want those things. That doesn't mean I or anyone should succumb to this pressure rather than live simply and sustainably, but I really appreciate that difficult aspect being included in the discussion.

As said by many of my other classmates, I do believe that Thoreau makes many valid points about the benefits of a more simplistic and lower scaled level of living to a more positive economically and environmentally sound society, but I still do have my doubts. Thoreau claims that luxuries hinder society in upward movement due to the fact that most of the influential thinkers of ancient times lived simpler lives seems to be a stretch. Yes having less stuff frees the mind for more open thought, but overall many of the most influential people in progressing society in the post-imperialism societies has come from people who started with a little, but only were able to make a major impact when they had more resources to do so.
       <br><br>

In my opinion I believe that minimalism is good for the individual to look into, but at massive scales, it seems just a bit too unrealistic to get the masses on board.




</p><hr>


<p>

In Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, Thoreau recounts his experience of choosing to live a more simplistic lifestyle over the fashion-obsessed lifestyle that those surrounding him indulged in. Thoreau significantly cuts back on the amount of objects cluttering his life and works for the bare necessities to live, spending the time that he gains from losing his desire to better the quality of his life for his studies and other academic interests. 
       <br><br>

What’s most interesting to me about the concepts described in the reading is the idea that people are “needlessly poor...because they think that they must have such [a house] as their neighbors…” and how this mentality has grown in today’s society. The American people live in a society based around the idea that “bigger is better” and that continuous growth is always good. While part of this is probably due to just the way a capitalist society works, I imagine part of it could also be attributed to people desiring a higher quality of life rather than settling for what they have now. While this mentality is quite admirable in its own right, many times it never seems to stop and just continues to grow. 
       <br><br>

While I cannot necessarily envision myself living in a pure minimalistic lifestyle the way Thoreau does, I think there are lessons to be learned from the way he views materialism. The continuous search for a better life is in a way unhealthy, when we could settle for less and use our time to improve ourselves. A house is not so much an asset but rather a liability when we send ourselves spiraling into debt over it. We should stop idolizing the idea of always having to better your quality of life, and learn to just simply be happy instead of sending ourselves into debt and depression.

I really like Walden and would like to, at some point, go out into nature myself and live for an extended period of time.  Yet I have a few gripes with Walden's critiques of society. I understand his critique on the large houses, fancy clothes, and working long hours just for material goods.  But he also critiques farmers and normal workers for not turning back on their life and starting a new one with less responsibility.  Now he can say this because he comes from a wealthy family and has no one to take care of.  Most people do not have the luxury of security.  While he does come from wealth, it hardly invalidates his accomplishment and message, it is just something to remember.  I think this is an issue we face today as well.  Coming from a society so reliant on fossil fuels, it is easy to criticize them and say we need to stop using them in total.  I agree that fossil fuels are bad and we need to move to using clean energy, but we need to recognize not everyone can afford to do so.  I would even go as far to say many people who want to stop using fossil fuels would have a hard time affording this new lifestyle. 

       <br><br>

I found it amazing that he only spend $36, or around $1200 today to live over two years.  That is far less than a months rent in San Francisco for one person.  I was also amused by his story of killing the woodchuck and eating it out of anger and curiosity.  This made the story seem very real to me and less like an idyllic utopian experience.  It was also interesting to see him call salt the grossest of all groceries and living without salt.  I have eaten vegetarian food without salt, and it is not easy.

When
I watched this video, it deepened my sadness about the American way of life
today. This is something I didn't expect before I took this course. As a
Chinese, I think Americans have a very luxurious way of life. For example, in
China, if a restaurant is closed, all its lights will be turned off, but in the
United States, whether the restaurant is open or not, its lights must be bright
all night. What's even more disappointing to me is that even our university
will offer courses on climate disasters under such a strong environmental
publicity. This bad habit of living in America is still deeply rooted. It seems
impossible to improve the earth's environment by improving one's living habits,
because he has been rooted in American life for too long.



       <br><br>


As
for vegetarianism, I don't think it will bring much help to environmental
protection. If a person insists on being a vegetarian, I will not object
because it is his personal choice. Some people may say that we can get the
nutrition of meat by taking supplement without eating meat, but I want to say
that we eat meat not only for nutrition, but also for delicacy and pleasure.
Besides, I think the impact of animal husbandry on the environment is far lower
than other factors, such as excessive industrial emissions, carbon dioxide
emissions and so on.

I will be honest when I say my first reaction to seeing Walden was to cringe. I had a hard time reading this book in Ap English in high school. I was a bit apprehensive to read this chapter from the book again. My first impressions from reading it were confusion and general dislike. I was frustrated why Thoreau made himself out to be so better than thou. Although I am not a huge fan of Thoreaus writing style, I did my best to start my reading with an open mind to see if high school me missed an actual message from this confusing book. 
       <br><br>
Thoreau has a very confusing writing style. Simply put I was still a bit confused when I reread this but I believe I have a much better understanding than I did years ago. A few major points that stood out to me the most were his opinions on Human necessities and desires. More specifically, he makes a priority to talk about Clothing, food, shelter, and ways of living. For example, in todays society, a main goal in most peoples lives is to have a large house and several cars and all of these extravagant things. Furthermore, we consume meat and industrialize meat production which is causing vast problems to our climate. Thoreau centralizes his time on building a small house by hand by Walden Pond. He recounts the exact prices of each nail and item he used to build the house. He alludes to the fact that we need to start focusing more on minimizing our footprint in this world and less on how much of something we can have. I was very confused why Ken would have us read this but I believed that confusion was based on my preconceived notions about the book. After revisiting the first chapter, I have a better understanding and respect for what Thoreau was doing and explaining.

After reading the first chapter of Walden, Thoreau introduces this back to nature lifestyle which I enjoyed to hear, as someone who enjoys camping and being as immersed in nature as possible. However after reading it in the mindset of someone living in this generation it is clear that that is simply not possible for everyone due to the large population.
       <br><br>

Although I did appreciate the fact that he reminds us that as humans we only need to satisfy our basic needs such as food, water and shelter. Everything after that is considered a luxury. In Walden he considers the cost of his resources needed and eats only what his body needs. This is interesting to hear because today we have variety and options in what we chose to eat. In a grocery store today we could buy a variety of fruits with ease without considering where they come from and the amount of resources used to make them. In addition, it’s important to notice the sizing of the cabin. Today we have a mentality where bigger is better, but in reality bigger is not better for the environment.

Scrolling through the comments, I see that many other students also read Thoreau’s Walden in their AP Lang class in high school. Three years ago, I read Walden in an analytical standpoint, but now I am reading it through the lens of a climate change activist. 
       <br><br>
This specific quote: “Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.” reminds me of the Youtube video “The High Price of Materialism”. People who are obsessed with material things obtain counterfeit and non lasting happiness. Considering this quote in this week’s discussion, everything is tied together - minimalism leads to a better climate and better mental health.
       <br><br>
I find it interesting how ancient philosophies/theories always come back and become relevant to the modern age. It makes me think that human behavior and life inherently stays the same, but varies depending on the age. Some other examples I can think of is Plato’s Symposium and Ovid’s Metamorphoses that talk about the complexity of gender and sexuality. A few hundred years later, we now live in an age where we are learning and acknowledging the multiple facets of those topics.

I think that the main idea of chapter one in Thoreau's "Walden" can apply to us today. This idea of living simply without any lavish things is, I believe, one of the ways that we can help fight the climate crisis that we are in. AS talked about in Professor Hiltner's video, we must consider our origin story and how it fits within the world. 

       <br><br>

But while I agree with what Thoreau is trying to get at in the first chapter, I must say that his approach is very extreme. It is not feasible for everyone to abandon their current lifestyles-it would greatly affect our current economic system as well as create new issues related to this wholly-different lifestyle change.

I think a lot of Walden's message is to show the reader that there may be a lot of things we think we need but are really just luxuries. I don't think he is wishing for everyone to stop what they're doing and live in the woods on the bare necessities but he uses his situation as an example of minimalism. I think if everyone tried taking a step back to see how menial all the things we use on a daily basis  really are, we would have an easier time consuming less, therefore having a smaller carbon footprint. Walden's cabin consisted of just a fireplace, table, a bed and a couple of chairs for company, this is proof of how little one needs to be happy and how we have all been tricked into believing that buying the latest technologies will make us happier.

I found Thoreau's Walden incredibly inspiring. This week’s exploration into minimalism has been very motivational as a whole, and has provoked me to think about what things in my own life have value and what is just excess. 
       <br><br>
Thoreau's dedication to living with only what was truly essential is incredibly admirable. He practiced vegetarianism and lived in a cabin smaller than my dorm room now. The reality of the climate crisis we’re facing now is that if we all lived a little more like Thoreau did in his experiment, the whole planet would be much better off. Yet, even though I like to think of myself as an optimistic person, I simply cannot picture that happening, Not unless, there can be some sort of powerful unifying social movement and restructuring of the portrayal of the issue in media.
       <br><br>
I’m at fault here myself, and looking through some of the other comments on this video, I’m not the only one who feels this way. I’m consciously not doing everything everything that I could be. I should be vegetarian, and air drying my clothes, and buying clothes from thrift stores. But for some reason I can’t bring myself to attain these realistic goals. This week I’ve been assessing my own habits of consumption, and I have a renewed energy to change them.

After reading Thoreau's, "Walden" It makes me think that Thoreau in the 21st century would be angered by the fact that Americans let their lives be consumed by consumerism and give reason to believe that their worth is measured in belongings. Throughout the reading, I was very confused that Thoreau was chastising the poor until I realized he was talking about those who were seeking and investing their true worth in the wrong things and instead, making their own lives harder. when Thoreau said, "Do not stay to be an overseer of the poor but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the world" it shows how the consumer industry has flipped his meaning of fulfillment in this day and age to fill that if you don't have the newest phone, shoe, clothing, etc. then you aren't truly worthy and don't maintain the same status as those who do have these things. Thoreau's idea of taking on a bigger burden for the sake of want instead of need in relation to the class and the 21st century reminds me of the fast fashion industry and the constant attempt to create a 'cheaper' version of whatever is out in the world that is trendy. Because of new industries like this, they help those who believe they don't have what everyone else has to 'achieve' these statuses and in the end affect the amount of waste that we produce. In response to Ken's question, Thoreau is on to something because he sees at an early stage that the real reason we don't feel fulfilled isn't that we don't have enough it's because we don't understand what we need.

I can see that modern ideas are inspired by Thoreau. Something we have been talking about long time, like minimalism, can be found in his book with original description, quote “Some things are really necessaries of life in some circles, the most helpless and diseased, which in others are luxuries merely, and in others still are entirely unknown”. I am thinking about the question that Professor Ken left to us, how will be Thoreau’s reaction if he could see the situation in 21st century. People seems not learning from his experience at all, still choosing the life style instead of necessary staffs. It must be pretty obvious that he would be disappointed by the nowadays environment. The development is exactly opposite of what he expected before. 
       <br><br>

People chase the luxury instead of what they really need, according to Thoreau, luxury is something useless. People want to get huge mansion with bunches of beautiful gardens, fashion clothes and so on. Human often do not realize what they really have, like the necessary thing they need. People do not satisfy what they have already gotten, but thinking about something that means less for them. How pity we are.

It was fascinating to me to read about a person in the 19th century speak about a seemingly modern set of ideals. It’s always surprising yet comforting to learn that ideas and beliefs transcend generations. Thoreau brings up a lot of interesting points, such as the four necessities of life and the idea that working is a burden.
       <br><br>

At first, Thoreau says that food and water are the only elements that are necessary for survival. Later on, however, he concedes that shelter and fuel have become more and more of a fundamental need. This is due to the fact that shelter is protective and fuel sustains heat, which are essential in modern day society. 
       <br><br>

The most intriguing part for me was the Thoreau’s previous involvement with and consideration of business. He first thought of Walden Pond as a good place for business, which completely contradicts the views he ends up developing during his stay in his cabin, as be believes that farmers are shackled to their farms. Adhering to his own but coincidentally minimalist set of standards, his view of the viability of business and doing more work than is required to live completely shifted. Nowadays, everyone is captivated by the idea of going to school, working hard to provide for ourselves or our families, and having enough to be able to retire comfortably. After all, the purpose of going to college is to prepare us and give us knowledge for our future careers. This begs the question: if we decide to follow Thoreau’s footsteps now, will our mindsets be changed as well?
       <br><br>

I think that the fact that just by performing this experiment, all of his beliefs about life and purpose transformed. However, I don’t believe our changes need to be as drastic as Thoreau’s. By simply being content with less, more appreciative of and respectful to nature, and not so concerned with being successful in the typical sense, we can achieve the peace that Thoreau gained. Thoreau provides a good model of what it looks like to live simply, which not only will benefit our mental state, but the physical state of our environment as well.

Having read Walden for English 22 last fall, I was surprised that Ken had us read it again for this class. However, after revisiting the ideas presented in the first chapter, I was reminded of its importance and continued relevance in our current society. I find it so interesting that clear parallels can be drawn between Thoreau’s views of society in 1846 and our views of modern society today. 
       <br><br>
The increased focus on consumerism, the ideas of an individual being “tied to their land”, and the emphasis on material goods in life was already present in the 1800s. If Thoreau had these views back then, I wonder how he would view modern society. I feel that the issues that he addressed in Walden back then have only become astronomically more prevalent today. 
       <br><br>
I also find it interesting how ahead Thoreau was of his time, he argues against the “necessities of life” and consumerism centuries before they would become increasingly relevant in today’s society.
       <br><br>
 I found his analysis of clothing particularly enlightening because I know that it will be addressed later in the class through documentaries such as “The True Cost”. It is incredible that Thoreau was thinking about these issues back then and they have become increasingly prominent in society today. Considering that there is close to 7.5 billion people on Earth, one has to consider the amount of clothing produced in our modern-day society.

<p>

Thoreau's Walden presents nothing new in terms of what is available and already present in our present modern society. What it does do is display the stigma surrounding those additives to a modern lifestyle that people view as outside the norm. In the video lecture, Ken suggests that none of the things previous generations had access to made them any happier inferring that the other lifestyle presents more options for happiness than the other. Though, I agree that one way is much, much more detrimental to the long-term health of the planet and all future generations I do not think this is as easy or novel a shift as Walden or Ken suggests. It is near impossible to imagine outside what you are given, and it seems as if we are reliant on a measly few generations to right the wrong of so many before them. Even before we would reach an equilibrium where we and future generations hold the majority stakes in the planet, we would be reeling from the decades of damage continually being done by the stubborn generations on their way out. The time isn't there,  I do not doubt humankind's plasticity and flexibility and I am sure that a massive social change will stir major lifestyle adjustments but the thought of people just doing it is hard to imagine because this just is not something that we have seen in our lifetimes or maybe the lifetimes of many generations before us.

Although “Walden” was written in 1854, many of its ideas are still incredibly relevant to our society today. One quote I found particularly striking was Thoreau’s statement that “the luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot.” This idea that people are not satisfied with a reasonable amount of things but rather feel the need to keep consuming to a ridiculous and unnecessary level is incredibly relevant today. We are never satisfied with the bare minimum and feel the need to have more, whether it is in order to show off and prove how successful we are or to fulfil some emptiness inside of us. While this obviously applies to the rich, as the actual quote suggests, this also applies to pretty much every middle-class American today. We are used to overconsumption, we have all you can eat buffets and sales where you can “buy one, get one,” we are not used to consuming just what we need. As Professor Hiltner mentioned, Thoreau is quite clearly an early proponent for minimalism. While his practices are to the extreme, which is why his project was only temporary, it is possible, and beneficial, to implement some of his proposed ideas. While we should not all move to the forest to live in a 150 square foot cabin we can part ways with some of our possessions and avoid replacing them with even more stuff.

       <br><br>

Another quote that I enjoyed from this first chapter was, “he has no time to be anything but a machine,” where the he being referenced is the average working person. Most people grow up with the idea that success is the goal of life and that to achieve this success we should go through our schooling to end up at a job that we will work at until we retire at an old age. And supposedly at this old age, we are then allowed to enjoy the hard work we did all our lives and feel that sense of success. This idea relates to the video “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy” because it suggests that if we were able to spend less time working we would have more time to improve ourselves. If we were not unhappy from working long hours we might not feel the need to fill this sadness with unnecessary purchases and might instead take up practices that benefit our society or even just our own well-being. 
       <br><br>


Thoreau’s statement that, “For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my hands, and I found that, by working about six weeks in a year, I could meet all the expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well as most of my summers, I had free and clear for study” reminded me of something Professor Hiltner said in his video lecture about the environmental implications of cars. When Professor Hiltner mentioned how if we did not spend so much of our income on purchasing, driving, and maintaining our cars and instead saved that money for retirement we could retire much earlier than we do now, this was a very similar idea. When we stop consuming so much and instead put our money towards worthwhile investments for our future we are able to live much more fulfilling lives. Some people encourage the practice of spending money on experiences rather than material objects, which can be much more fulfilling and often more environmentally conscious. Rather than buying a newer car or a bigger house maybe consider spending that extra money on some type of hobby that you enjoy such as going to a concert or visiting a museum. 
       <br><br>


Overall much of Thoreau's first chapter of “Walden” is somewhat difficult to dive into but when read with an environmental lens it is obviously quite influential. Thoreau was encouraging minimalism before it even had a name, and it is far past due that we take his advice and live a more meaningful life with less material items to tie us down.

In Henry's David Thoreau "Walden" the first chapter was an interesting reading. His writing was a bit hard to read through it took me while in trying to get Thoreau writing. Thoreau is seen as minimalist in his own time. Thoreau introduces the chapter by saying that he lived for 2 years in a cabin that he built. This cabin was built in the woods away from people. In his chapter he mentions that it is easier to acquire items than to get rid of them. Which is believe that is true. It is a lot easier to buy something and keep buying stuff rather then getting rid of stuff. A simple life is what Thoreau was looking for and did for a while. It is something that at his time probably seem as something that was not necessary at all. There is a part that he stated “it is such a relief from both moral and physical systems “. Getting rid of things that are not necessary at all can really help you as a whole. Not only you as a person but help out the planet.  
       <br><br>

I would think that Thoreau would to a certain extent be honestly surprised and not in a good way on how much people or consuming. He was be disgusted at the lavish lives that people are living. This society well on other words The US is so materialist. Instead of living a simpler less complex life everything is about having the newest material stuff. Having The new clothing and phone legit everything is what this capitalist society is pushing for. The society we live in is so wasteful.

Thoreau pursued minimalism in his life, sustaining himself with what he can. Sounds familiar? Thoreau talks about the trend of lavishness and unnecessary properties and measures of success. Sounds familiar again? I think that yeah that's cool Thoreau has all these "wow we have to go back to nature idea" but what about the indigenous folx that have been doing these things all their life and ancestry, until white people came to colonize them and stripped all their livelihood away? Indigenous people have been working on these lands long before settlers came. Indigenous people knew the way of the Earth, the soil, the water, and how to live with it without damaging it. Indigenous people just don't have the resources to write a book like this and have people respect them enough to publish it and tell the world. Why don't we all just humble down and listen to the people that gave been here so long before all of us.  
       <br><br>

Lastly, the idea of ownership . How it is very colonial to want to own objects and properties, to think that the more stuff one has, the more successful this person it. It is, in his time, bold of him to give up everything that would have contributed to his material success. And it is curious Ken mentioned happiness in this video. I think at this fight against climate change, I have stopped thinking of happiness but more of safety. WE ARE NOT SAFE and we will never be unless people are taken out of power and the oppressed are lifted and recognized.

Recently, I have been reading a lot of John Muir's different writings. In one of his writings, he talked about his youth and his first dog named Watch. Long story short, Muir's dog ended up killing some of his neighbor's chickens, and as a result, had to be put down. In his novel, Muir wrote "So poor Watch was killed simply because his taste for chicken was too much like our own." When I first read this, I sat and wondered, why don't most of our pets and livestock eat meat if we so strongly swear by it? Obviously there's reasoning like the loss of energy, but then why don't we swear by the diets that our livestock eat. While this story is unrelated to Walden, it is what I thought of when Thoreau said "One farmer says to me, 'You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with.'" When it comes to veganism in our current age, I feel that people still have the same mindset. They knock a plant-based diet, most likely just as a way to justify their indulgence in meat. We, as a culture, love to indulge, whether it be with food, or our cars and homes. 
       <br><br>

Thoreau's Walden goes on to talk about this culture of consumerism. In response to the question of what man might want next, he says "Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and richer food, larger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothes, more numerous, incessant, and hotter fires, and the like." Everything that Thoreau is saying is still relevant today. This was written almost 200 years ago... before mass advertising was put into place. You would have thought that people would have realized the cycle we were falling in, yet we have only fallen deeper into it.

To respond to the question, “is Thoreau on to something” when concerning minimalizing, I wholeheartedly agree that he is. The only thing that upsets me is that he only managed to live for 2 years in this simplistic, isolated region of Massachusetts until he decided it was time to head back home. His critiques of consumerism are the same fights that we, environmentalists, are having today with big corporations, an example of this being Thoreau’s hatred of excessive consumption on environmental grounds. I was surprised by the choice of Walden at first, however, as I originally thought Thoreau’s work was more on the side of getting back to humans original roots rather than an early call for help concerning the climate crisis. After completing the reading, however, I came to understand the Thoreau spoke about his time there in a way that could fit into both categories. Upon reading this I was concerned however, due to the fact that a call for the return to nature may actually be a worse strain on the climate crisis. I say this because Thoreau’s writing has a strong appeal to readers in regards to the beauty and serenity of nature while disregarding the difficult parts of it, which could easily lead to the mass migration of people into the wilderness and thus transform the peace and serenity into the hustle and bustle already experienced in cities before. I do respect Thoreau’s ideas on economy and minimalism, especially his usage of apparel until it was unable to function, rather than keeping up with modern trends and wasting the earth's resources. I feel that if we abide to the rules Thoreau proposes, such as conserving natural materials by minimizing your closet, society will live in much more peace and harmony as life wouldn’t always be a constant financial competition in order to prove oneself to his peers.

“Climate change is a hoax that promotes more governmental control over the rights of people!”
          <br><br>
  As I was reading the first chapter in Thoreau’s work Walden, it reminds me of this claim made by the people who don’t believe in climate change. Aside from the idea of transcendentalism, “returning to the nature” and seek the spirituality in one’s life, this chapter makes me think about what is true freedom. Many people are striving for better houses, a better cars, better furniture, etc, however unknowingly getting trapped by their own desire, by their own possession. People are working for things that they don’t need, and as a result they become slaves to their pursuits. As Thoreau states in this chapter that people feel better with a broken leg than with a piece of patched clothing on. It is true that there are plenty of items that we can purchase in a store, but this materialistic approach to life has not freed us, but bounded us to the “clothing”, or the properties that we own as a part of ourselves. The freedom is not how much stuff you can acquire, but how easy it is to acquire the necessities. And the question is, are we relinquishing our rights in any way by living a simpler life? 
       <br><br>
   Although unfortunately we cannot take his way of living as a reference for our survival in the present day, and indeed living a life of complete independency is close to impossible, I believe that the idea of living simply just gets proven to not only be beneficial to the environment, but also beneficial in an individual level, and in no way living simply counts as a loss of rights.
       <br><br>
   It is also interesting to note that Thoreau also expresses his opinion on older generations. I do find it is quite extreme for him to say that people from older generations have taught him nothing, but I agree that the experience that comes from the older generation is partial. And the fact that because many elderly people today claim that the climate change had not happened during their time give some credit to this statement.

The "Walden" by Henry David Thoreau's made me realize that we do not need a lot of objects and tools to survive in this world. I believe that Henery would be very angry and sad that nothing has changed. He warned about fashion being a problem in the 19th century because it labels how rich and trendy you are in society. We still have this problem to this day. People think that having the best fits will give them happiness and show that they have power but in reality, it will just. lead to sadness. David would also argue about the housing we have today. We still have big houses that only rich people can afford while other poor people are living homeless or renting apartments. The savages I believe are the landowners because they are making a profit of the people renting the apartments. These people will keep paying the rent and will have a very low chance of buying a real house. 
       <br><br>


  I believe that we can still change our ways and make society simple. We do have to have everything in the world because where is the happiness from that. The main part of true happiness I believe is the experiences and relationships you create in order to make this world a better place. Not trying to do anything you can to get everything in the world. Because once you buy everything,  you would have never thought of anyone else but yourself.

I found Thoreau's ideas to be very interesting. I was surprised how he critiqued society as a whole and how much of what he was saying is still, and if not more relevant to today's society. His argument that material goods were the things that limit our abilities to become true philosophers and have a clear mind was probably the most intriguing thing he mentioned in his writing. It got me thinking about how most of what we have been taught in society about what it means to have wealth and be successful derives from a consumerist and capitalistic culture that we now live under.  In reality there is no true measure for success but the one that we as a society create and place upon each other. I also find it intriguing that he was a wealthy man who wanted to try this minimalistic way of living almost as though it was an experiment,  and wanted to test out how doable it is. I do think it could be a little problematic for him to compare the minimalistic/natureful  way of living to that of a "savage" lifestyle because it creates a binary of savage vs civilized which not only makes one seem like its a villain, but also romanticizes one on the other side of the spectrum. Nonetheless, I think he did a great job pointing out flaws in our capitalistic/materialistic system and makes us question if this way of living is truly benefiting us as a society.

In the reading, I noticed a question that “Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born?” Everyone requires an amount of resources once they are born, and every resource produces CO2 so that more greenhouse gases are emitted. However, as a result of producing these much of CO2, natural environment will eventually be destroyed. Compared with animals, human requires clothes and fire which leads to a rapid increase of greenhouse gases. Industrial revolution gives more opportunities for people to have cars, but mostly they needs gasoline as power, and gasoline burn causes a really large part of greenhouse increase. However, in this situation, there are still a number of people would not choose electronic one as their transportations. Think of today’s technology, there are actually ways to change that we will not begin digging our graves as soon as we are born, but all of these needs actions by public.

It's surprising to see that Henry David Thoreau's 'Walden'  is one of the most highly regarded works of American literature, yet we continue on a path of extreme materialism and idealized lavish lifestyles. The American Dream really emphasizes success as the opposite of what Thoreau preaches. I'm also guilty of this mindset because I do think money is important, and I believe it can buy happiness to some extent. Financial stability, a safe place to sleep, and sustainable amount of food no doubt gives peace of mind, but the constant accumulation of unnecessary things creates waste and clutter. I have so many things that I almost never use, clothes I barely wear, and papers I'll never look at, and I know I spend way too much time on my cellphone. I have this fantasy in my mind that I often think about before I sleep-- I dream about an idyllic life in the countryside, away from the fuss and noise of electronics, social media, and constant advertising for things in my face. In this fantasy, I find happiness in the simple things in life rather than in objects, but I fall asleep thinking that this will never happen in real life because I am just too dependent on the convenience of the internet and unnecessary items. When I was reading about Thoreau's simplified lifestyle and his exploration of the spiritual values of life that can make people happy, I was especially immersed because he actually achieved what I think about in my dreams. Reading this chapter motivates me to be more active in getting rid of the items that I don't really need and incorporate more aspects of minimalism into my life.

After reading Henry David Thoreau's "Walden", it is almost comical how little has changed from now till than in terms of mass consumption and gluttony that persists. Just like generations of past, we in the present are always on a quest to fulfill our impulsive urges/desires, such as buying into the latest in fashion, which may sequester our desires temporarily, but soon enough we will go onto wanting another thing. All in all, we have been trained to enter a positive feedback loop of mass consumption in which we feel that the only way to feel fulfilled and happy is to constantly find something new to buy. In reality though, if we were to isolate ourselves from society, this whole idea of mass consumption would be void from our minds; it is foreign to our natural human state. According to Thoreau, the only necessities we need in life is food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. By living a simple life, it allows us to focus on ourselves and the happiness that the environment around us brings rather than the unnecessary "luxuries" that plague our current society. It is challenging to practice this simple lifestyle in today's society, but we are certainly starting to see a trend of more and more people practicing this to not only help prevent the further polluting of our planet, but to also gain eternal equilibrium and happiness. It is something that I am personally trying my best to work on and hopefully we all together will hopefully defeat.

After reading Walden, the sentence most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind” impressed me a lot. It related to the main idea of the film minimalism and also main points that many environmentalists have proposed before. Living in a modern society in which tendency and fashion dominates over other valuable thoughts or philosophies. The point is that we keep buying things for following fashions or comparing to others, that we do not need at all. 
       <br><br>

Thoreau is actually the best representative of minimalism. He thought about life, about thoughts and about how to live in a meaningful way. He mentions necessities like shelter, food, and warmth. These are basic needs for humans but he says that we want more even we have all of these. In fact, facing so many choices of commodities, we like to buy things we like. We are not pursuing things to survive now but enjoying, art or any spiritual appreciation. We pursuit high qualities in life. In fact, I believe the pursuit is one of the main differences between us and primitive humans. However, the conflict is that the pursuit we are chasing now is the main cause of the climate crisis. We have to make a choice. I think this is what we need to seriously consider in the following years.

The book Walden and the documentary Minimalism convey the same meaning: less is more. Both of them encourage a simplified lifestyle which indicates that if we give up stuff that is not necessary, we can not only save money and time but also reduce lots of confusion and anxiety because we only focus on things that really matter in life. Thoreau begins by outlining his two-year project at Walden Pond. He said he will live here for two years, two months, and two days, and then moved back to civilized society. He acknowledged that this is not a permanent lifestyle rather an experiment in living. Thoreau identifies only four necessities: food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. The good thing is that nature itself does much to provide these for us, so basically we don’t need any extra things. I found an interesting thing that many readers enjoy pointing out the shortcomings of his project. For example, someone argues that he claims to live in self-reliance, but he builds a shack on another man’s property with borrowed tools and gifts of lumber. However, his purpose is not to do a perfect experiment but to show people the meaning of self-reliance is not only paying one’s bill with debt; it is to claim ownership of your life. As for building the house, Thoreau is relying more or less on his own labor and costs only a small amount of money. His experiment teaches a lesson that we don’t need that much stuff to live, and we might be happier if we live a simple life.

After reading Henry David Thoureau’s, “Walden”, I was interested in the idea of living simply and how a simpler life isn't necessarily worse than a grandiose life. Having moved a few times in my life, from a very big house to continuously smaller houses, I always thought it was interesting how I never felt any less happy moving to smaller living spaces, or even having less nice things. I very quickly adjusted to the new living situations and was equally happy. The only time I got happy from a change like this was going from a worse to a nicer situation, whether this was upgrading equipment, or moving to a new place. This was most likely because I never appreciated the nice things I had until I experienced the other side and came back. An example of this is moving to a college dorm from home, I was perfectly happy there until I visited home again after a while and realized how much nicer it was. I say this because I think moving from a more complex to a simpler life won't be as hard as people think. I believe that material gains aren't directly correlated with happiness and that many people can choose to live a simpler life without affecting their overall happiness. I still recognize, however, that it'll be a hard change for many people, especially because not everyone will immediately make a change. With how people like to flaunt their wealth and items, the people making the change might be discouraged to continue their shift.

I agree with you when you stated that moving into a smaller place with less material objects would not take too much modification from a person, and would most likely make them happier. After all, the human species is very good at adjusting. After reading "Walden" by Henry David Thoreau, it seemed to me that once he had moved out into a place with no city commotion, and rid his life of the many stressors, he became much more satisfied with himself and his life. He had spent hardly any money on his shelter and the crops he grew. These things were still able to meet the necessary means of life, and on top of that, growing your own food is probably much more satisfying than buying something you did not make, or something that is premade. I think that Thoreau would be shaking his head at our present situation, especially when it comes to the U.S. There are even more people obsessed with consuming and living with material objects than during the author's lifetime. Still, as Thoreau seemed to already know, consuming does not make one happier. In fact, it only gives the mind pleasure for a short period of time, and once this feeling subsides people only want to buy more to gain that happy feeling again. What I took from this chapter of the book is that we truly do not need to be living in these large houses, and do not need to be buying things in excess. If we all were to take to the woods and quit the work we do just to make ends meet, we would be a much happier group of people. On top of that, it would be much more environmentally sustainable. Although it may not be realistic for me to take a step in this direction in my life just yet, I definitely want to venture out of my comfort zone and live with nature, like we were born to do. Whether this happens when I am 25 or 60 years old, I will make sure to appreciate every moment of it. But for now, I will begin to limit the things I have in my house, as well as limit the things I buy and consume. As Thoreau had put it, simplifying your life ultimately makes things better. It will make things better for oneself, along with the rest of the world!

After reading Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, I was fascinated by his simple lifestyle. He spent two years in the woods on the north shore of Walden Pond, a lake near Concord in Massachusetts. It is both a practical and philosophical account of how he sustained himself through farming and by building his own house, and what he learned about human nature by living a simpler life.
       <br><br>

As far as I am concerned, it is necessary to experience simple life sometimes, especially for people who always live in cities with fast working pace. In this way, people will get relaxed. Besides, it is good for climate. If all of us live in the same way as Thoreau did, the emission of carbon dioxide will be reduced by a large amount. Thoreau never drive a car, buy many clothes, and use too much electricity. However, he still lived with happiness. What surprised me the most is that he only work for six weeks a year to support his whole year life. By this fact, we can directly perceive how simple his life is. But nowadays, people always spend their money in buying luxuries, which are useless but expensive. Also, people are relying on technology in daily lives nowadays. Technology does bring us convenience, but it also brings some side effects. For example, overuse of technology made our planet warming. Since the beginning of industrial revolution, the burning of fossil fuel has increased a lot, resulting in carbon dioxide emits into the atmosphere. After that, our planet become warmer and warmer. However, in the past, there was not many technology devices invented. Thus, the carbon dioxide level is incredibly lower.
       <br><br>

In short, living in a simpler life would be better to our future environment. Just try to but less clothes, consume less meat, and use less electricity. Less is more!

Walden by Henry David Thoreau was a great read and I’d recommend it. Reading Walden made me consider making changes in my own life and most likely I will follow through. I actually read a bit of Walden in high school, however, I never finished it and now I can. I think it is quite honorable of Thoreau to sacrifice living lavishly and instead settle for a small cabin in the woods. This is very different from how most modern Americans live in today’s world. In today’s world, many people want to live in a big home, have a large gas-guzzling vehicle, and have the latest clothes that are up to date with the trends. However, do these things really make us happy? Do we really need to have an enormous home with ten rooms and a pool larger than an aquarium? How about instead of making superficial things the goal, we should try to make living minimalistic a trend.  Another thing that I found interesting was Thoreau’s take on clothing and constant consumerism. Instead of constantly buying new clothing, he had a few single sturdy pieces of clothing that would last him. Also, becoming vegetarian and deciding to abstain from eating meat was a smart move on his part because one pound of beef is equivalent to 30 pounds of lentils. Imagine how much water we could save on agriculture if we stopped consuming meat? Facts like these make me consider going vegan or vegetarian because I want to help end the climate crisis as soon as possible.

What I'm getting at is that modern day life can be incredibly over the top. The excessive behaviors that I both see and partake in daily are to a certain extent, gross. The amount of table-to-counter trips I make in one sitting at DLG is ridiculous! I'm not hungry enough to eat 4 pieces of pizza, a thing of meat, a burger, and some fries, But, tomorrow's gonna come around and I'm sure I'll find myself eating just that! I'm sure of this because of our modern day way of life. We love to do everything to the fullest. While this can be good for some things, i.e. studying, loving, and squats, it is very bad when it comes to consumption. Overconsumption leads to a lot of problems, especially environmental ones. Whether over consuming takes an edible form for you, or a more material form, the outcome is the same: wasted resources. To compensate for waste, more has to be put in, effectively increasing that rate at which we run through any variety of resources worldwide. To slow down on the way we are charging through these resources, we should slow down our consumption. This is how I think this article fits well into our lectures. Adopting simpler ways of life feeds directly into using less. When we use less, we need to make less. When we need to make less, we have less production. When we produce less, we place a lot slighter strain on the environments we are taking from.

In the book "Walden", the beginning is the "Economy", which is nearly a quarter of the book. This shows that the author attaches importance to this issue, from which his views on the problems of survival. The "Economy " roughly consists of two parts: an analysis of people's actual survival predicament; an analysis of the survival necessities; and the author's own survival experiment on Walden Lake.
       <br><br>

Life needs heat to be maintained. Thoreau believes that human clothing, food, and shelter solve the problem of heat of life, and these can be obtained without much cost. Thoreau pointed out that what we need is not necessities but luxury goods. The fruit of extravagance is still extravagance, it will only lead to the infinite expansion of desire and pay for it. Necessities of life, as a necessity for survival, guarantee that we solve real-life problems and start the adventure of life, instead of indulging in the swamp of desire and becoming "tools of tools". Thoreau advocates a simple life. It is simple and not restricted by a desire to gain spiritual independence and freedom. This is a simple but difficult truth. We are accustomed to seeing things in different colors and listening to all directions. We are obsessed with all kinds of entertainment. Thoreau's life, like a primitive man at Lake Walden, is nothing more than a nightmare to us. He built his own house, farmed himself, slashed fire, and kept away from the fetters and temptations of all modern civilization. He was even jailed for refusing to pay taxes. The traditional bread method requires fermentation, but Thoreau "invented" the bread method without fermentation, and this method is also recorded in ancient literature. Thoreau used a bowl of Indian polenta to welcome his friends from afar. His criticisms and questions about modern civilization made us think deeply and reflect on ourselves. We do live habitually in established patterns, inertial comparisons, anxiety, and fear, without ever questioning this lifestyle. How do we choose between the freedom of primitive people and the shackles of civilized people? All this requires us to further understand Thoreau. To understand Thoreau, we must first understand ourselves. Unfortunately, in the course of the entire civilization, or in the social development driven by material desires, we collectively lose ourselves. We seem to reverse the order of life, lose the sovereignty of life, and become slaves to desire. Thoreau, the forerunner, spared no effort to awaken us in our nightmares with his own experience and wise philosophies, abandoning the extravagance of luxury, cutting off the shackles of desire, returning the vitality of life, and enjoying the local scenery. At the end of the "Economy", he once again emphasized that we can restore our original vitality as simple and peaceful as nature.
       <br><br>

Simplicity, independence, honesty, and freedom are the survival concepts in Thoreau's "Economy", awakening our deeply sleeping rational soul, let us reexamine everything commonplace and established, and consider the possibility of a new way of life.

This is my first time reading “Walden” by Thoreau. I’m glad that I found a great book. The Economy chapter is the one that contains true experience as well as philosophy. Though the generation and world Thoreau experienced differed a lot from ours, there are still tons of truths that never perish. Reading Thoreau’s work reminds me that what I never touched before but should figure out remains a lot more. Navigating in the midst of the modern world I almost forget how the world with only primitive technology looks like, and people seem to catch the amnesia of gaining necessities by using hands. I’m astonished by my feeling since I regard myself as keeping in mind the origin of everything. It is so true that, as Thoreau mentioned, vanity is the strongest part that drives people away from the original life spend with nature. “I desire that there may be as many different persons in the world as possible;” Thoreau said, “but I would have each one be very careful to find out and pursue his own way, and not his father's or his mother's or his neighbor's instead.” Though Thoreau emphasized that the most useful and rational method to achieve his level is to pursue your own way, I think to reduce the effect of consumerism and get rid of vanity applies to most people because of the modern situation. More importantly, mentioned by Ken in his video, we need to ponder on our roles and reconsider and try to rewrite the script handed to us. Not only philosophers like Thoreau but also the general public possess the ability to stand away comfort zone and reexamine our lifestyle. Enlightened by Thoreau’s notion and inspired by his success, I have a long way to go.

The first chapter of “Walden” by Henry David begins by matter-of-factly outlining his two-year project at Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts. He moves quickly to the moral of his experiment: to illustrate the benefits of a simplified lifestyle. The first chapter introduces to the oddball hodgepodge of styles, allusions, and subject matter that the work as a whole. In a prophetic vein he tells us that his Walden experiment was intended to instruct his fellow men, who “labor under a mistake” about life, work, and leisure. When I was young I thought of leaving far from the society, and live alone in a cabin, but it was just daydreaming and I never make it come true. When I grow up, I barely look back to the daydream until I read “Walden.” I live in a world full of technology, and I can’t imagine how to live alone without any of these. I order food on apps or drive through, I can’t imagine how to grow food with my own hands. That is too absurd for me. But when I read “Walden,” I start to think: am I living my life, or life is living on me?

After reading the first chapter of Henry David Thoreau's "Walden," I found it extremely interesting that somebody would want to strip themselves to the absolute bare minimum of what it takes to survive. Why would somebody want to ever do that? And furthermore, how could somebody actually survive (considering the nearly inhospitable conditions of the 19th century wilderness)? As he mentions in the chapter, Thoreau only spend $28.12 on shelter costs ($870 when adjusted for modern inflation). Although he describes his various struggles with his minimal shelter, he was still able to survive in his minimalistic conditions.

       <br><br>

I believe the point of this experiment was to show that humans are intelligent and resourceful enough to survive without all the privileges that modern society has to offer. After all, humans have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years without homes with power, cars, and other conveniences that humans have become accustomed to. With that being said, it is entirely possible for us to cut back on our resource use and live a much more minimalistic lifestyle for the sake of being more sustainable in terms of Earth's resources. Sure, the sacrifices required to endure this lifestyle may seem impossible, but we will still survive in the end, as Thoreau has proven. If we all lower our expectations in terms of modern privileges and accept our place in this grand biosphere, then we will all be able to coexist peacefully without running the risk of depleting all of the planet's resources.

The simplistic lifestyle described in "Walden" reminded me of my high school US history class' brief addressing of the transcendentalist writers who essentially founded the western environmentalist movement. Things in the first chapter, like the narrator dedicating himself to a life of self-sustaining work and minimalism, reminded me of many figures I learned about in my Zen Buddhism class last quarter. I think it's interesting and whitewashing as a perspective that pieces like "Walden" and people like Thoreau, Aldo Leopold, and other white men are seen as the founders of the environmental movement when often, these men were predated by people of other races and cultures who were erased: Zen Buddhist monks, practitioners of Daoism, and Native Americans are a few groups that come to mind who went unnoticed during the whitewashing of the environmental movement. While "Walden" is a valuable piece in Western environmentalism, I feel that erasing the history that it stemmed from (minimalist Buddhist lifestyles and renunciation of physical objects) dismisses key pieces of wisdom in the movement for environmental justice.

       <br><br>

I found Walden's abandonment of regular society after realizing they did not properly value his work similar to the way a Buddhist ascetic might reject typical aspects of society, and his beliefs about philanthropy similar how many Buddhist practitioners did not believe virtue came from acting positively towards others, but just acting positively in general.

In reading Henry David Thoreau's "Walden," he told an account of living a simple lifestyle in a cabin. He focuses on his satisfaction with a few belongings such as a few clothing items and his efforts to find meaning in life. Published in the 19th century, Thoreau speaks upon the necessities of life, and the importance of living with those basic needs rather than seeking more. In being critical about the consumption of clothing and other items, Thoreau is precise about the means of simple living arrangements, in ways such as taking measures of food and clothing. 
       <br><br>
In reading the text, I wondered what Thoreau would think of the 21st century's mass consumption of trendy items and purchasing beyond what we need. The world has changed a lot since the 19th century, as we can seen in Thoreau's work. These changes can be seen today from technological innovations, production, larger homes, and even by means of advertisement. One way of looking at this has been through modern lifestyles of larger homes, with large flat screen televisions and additional rooms. For instance, what would Thoreau think of something like fast fashion? "Walden"  even from 1854, is important to consider today, as we chase a life that is beyond what we need, thinking that it will bring us fulfillment.




</p><hr>


<p>
In "Walden: Economy," Henry David Thoreau prompts a simple lifestyle and the benefits of the lifestyle. After we satisfied the basic needs with the cooperation of nature, some people pursue a "comfortable" and even luxurious life. Such a "comfortable" life is a waste of resources. Once people started to enjoy a comfortable life, they would greedily pursue a better life, which is unnecessary. It is human nature to pursue a better life, and it is also impossible to fulfill the human desire. Once the desires exceed much more than human basic needs, the desires are waste in natural resources and would damage the environment. 
       <br><br>
Simple lifestyle can not only save human resources, but also train the human spirits. For example, the fast-fashion industry harms the environment, and a lot of people cannot stop shopping for extra clothes at low prices. People can buy fewer clothes with higher quality.





</p><hr>


<p>

The excerpt of Walden serves as a different perspective of what many perceive to be the goals of life : luxury, wealth, and comfort. Society define these things as materialism and extravagance, and teach it's children the same cycle. Thoreau shows in the quote, "Undoubtedly, in this case, what is true for one is truer still for a thousand, as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one..." He points out the fact that humanity does not require large plots of land and houses to have a comfortable lifestyle. The wealthy owning large homes are disproportionately using up all the resources as many people could easily survive in a mansion.
       <br><br>
This article is very interesting as it bring sup a whole other issue regarding climate crisis. It tales the psychology that is lying at the root of all problems. It is the mindset that one must amass as much as they can in their possession to be happy that is pushing the disproportionate rates of pollution between wealthy and third world countries.

The reading this week overwhelmingly made me think how selfish we all are, what I am writing might seem harsh, but we think of our own comfort and our own immediate satisfaction rather than think about the climate crisis. My generation might be speaking more openly about the climate crisis however, in our everyday lives we are arguably doing much worse than the pervious generations. We buy more material things, throw away more thing and quicker, we eat more (and especially meet), we have bigger houses and we consume more energy than ever before. Industries such as fast fashion, which is growing exponentially and has a huge impact on pollution of rivers and water systems, would not see so much success if there was no demand for what they produce. What is hurting the planet is what each of us is doing collectively that is damaging the planet. This book, or rather the first chapter made me think about my lifestyle and everyday actions that have a much bigger impact on my life. Like the large majority of people I don’t think of my carbon footprint every time I buy new clothes or drive to the bank instead of taking the bus. However, if all of us could buy 1 less item of clothing a year, or switch from beef burgers to turkey burgers, we could all collectively decrease our own carbon footprint as well as decrease the demand for those items and therefore reduce production of a lot of unsustainable products. My main takeaway from this chapter is not necessarily live minimally but to make small adjustments to our daily activities which would in turn have positive consequences globally.

<p>
While reading “Economy” from Thoreau’s Walden, I found myself agreeing with much of his points, thus, observing that his values seem very ahead of his time. Upon further thinking, I wondered if rather than being ahead of his time, these minimalist and simple lifestyles have simply always been around and valued by certain people while others strive for an extravagant and high-consuming way of life. Because I took Ken’s English 22 class last quarter I know that Thoreau actually had several privileges that allowed him to live simply in the woods, however, when considering the text at face value there are many insights that draw parallels with environmental ideals today, one of them being the minimizing of our wardrobe. As clothing trends become mainstream and consumerism becomes encouraged, it seems almost impossible to not give into constantly purchasing new clothing that will most likely be “outdated” within a year. Fast fashion companies especially make the consumer feel like what they’re wearing is no longer in style, therefore, coaxing them into buying more and more and more - and consequently throwing their old clothes into the landfill. As Thoreau suggests, I personally am trying to minimize my wardrobe and having it consist of pieces I can enjoy for a long time, not just while it’s trending. 

       <br><br>

I definitely agree with Thoreau on the idea that having more material items is actually more so a burden than a luxury. Yes, having the money to buy things is a privilege, but I think there’s something empowering about being grounded solely in yourself rather than filling a void with material items. In “Economy” Thoreau says, “I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of,” which is to imply that owning many things is actually unfortunate which ties into his concept of questioning what we were born into. If we are born into a family who drives cars, consumes modern-day luxuries, and is mindlessly wasteful then we are more likely to live the same way. Because of this, as environmentally conscious beings who have been born into an environmentally destructive culture, we must unlearn the way of life we’ve been conditioned into. It’s a weird sensation to explain, but I personally feel so stressed out when I have things that I know I don’t use or need, it’s like an itch I need to scratch - the scratch being getting rid of the useless items and making room in my life for things I do value. 
       <br><br>


Thoreau’s words “necessary of life” are also very crucial to today’s climate because I feel as though some who are reluctant to a more simple lifestyle think that they can only own one shirt and one pair of pants when in reality, it doesn’t have to be that extreme, but it also can’t be on the other spectrum of extremity either. It’s about balance while maintaining a mindful rate of consumption and keeping in mind what is necessary. When you become a victim of the hedonic treadmill is when you forgo any moderation and self-control. All in all, Thoreau’s ideas are completely applicable to today’s climate issues and also just beneficial for self-improvement.

Prior to reading Thoreau, I was initially curious behind the system to the madness for including that chapter in a class about the climate crisis, however, the more I read the more I understood as to why Ken incorporated it into our curriculum. The various analogies and comparisons that Thoreau makes in the chapter, have various applications to how people live their life regarding their contributions to the climate crisis. He references a lot about how the values, traditions, and cultures of mankind date back to its creation; for example Hippocrates telling us how to cut our nails, which has, and still is, the very standard that most cultures follow. My favorite part of the chapter, was how he drew real time references to cultures where their values go beyond materialistic goods and I think it’s very important to consider this especially in a day and age where technology is ever so expanding and becoming more advanced. Looking at the philosophers of Chinese, Greek, Hindoo, and Persian background, their outward riches are almost nonexistent, however, their innard riches are of the utmost degree. All in all, I took this chapter as a reality check as to how humans should take a step back and appreciate what they have, rather than being obsessed with the very materialistic goods that contribute to the climate crisis.

While reading Henry David Thoreau's Walden, I couldn't help but notice the stark contrast between the ideas Thoreau presents and the consumer-based society of America today.  I found this quote from the reading quite interesting and when I read I honestly stepped back for a minute and just thought about it: "Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new." The idea of what's fashionable is so clearly put into our consciousness by the forces of societal pressure. Although we make fun of the fashion of the past, if we lived in those times we would be loving and consuming that style just as everyone else did. This idea goes beyond the realm of fashion but just any product industry in general. Our society values the new and next best thing and laughs at the old, conditioning us to drop whats old and eat up anything that comes out. We feel inclined to have the best phone, the in clothes, and the nicest car we can afford even though it doesn't satisfy us and leaves us wanting more.  Although many of us are self-aware and know we will always desire more no matter how much we currently have, we will still go along and desire because that is our role as a consumer.

<p>

From the time I was in high school, I knew I wanted to devote at least a year of my life to living away from society, completely secluded in nature as Thoreau lays out in his narrative. Even before I had read Walden, I have been conforming to this naturalistic life in many ways already, and after reading it I was all the more intrigued to pursue the ways we can cherish and connect with the natural world. As a vegan, it's been easy for me so far in this course to feel as though I'm already doing my part to contribute to fighting the climate crisis. More than that, I felt like there wasn't much more than I could do besides changing my diet and being more energy and water conscious. 
       <br><br>


One thing that really hit me was the huge contributions the fashion industry adds to the crisis, especially when considering the wasted material from over-production. We mass produce so much and throw it all away as soon as it doesn't fit with the newest trends. Reading Walden and watching this video has seriously made me consider when, and more importantly, if I need to buy new clothes.

Thoreau was far ahead of his time in his thinking about our roles as humans on this earth. His ideas to simplify our lives and limit consumption and waste are goals that people strive for now but seem incredibly forward-thinking for his time. He saw the value in a simple lifestyle, not because if its environmental impact but for personal improvement. He was able to see that excess bogged people down rather than making their lives easier. This served as an inspiration to go in the opposite direction. He believed that minimizing possessions can be freeing. Thoreau then goes on to demonstrate the benefits of a simpler life by starting his two year project. Even without the environmental concerns, he showed how beneficial a simplified life can be. With how much affect our actions have on the environment we have far more reason to simplify than he did.  People in his time used far less than we do currently, but even that was enough to raise his concern. If he were around today I'm sure he would be incredibly disappointed in the way we lead our lives. The way that most of us live our lives is incredibly wasteful, and Thoreau challenges this. He makes you consider the consumption decisions you make, but far more important, he makes you question the role you are destined to fill on this earth.

How much time are we working for the real needs of life today? How much time is there for your vanity, extravagance, competition, desire to work hard and die endlessly? Are we like Thoreau said: to make money in the best time of life, in order to use it in the most worthless time of life? So Thoreau doesn't say that economy is not important to people. What he wants us to avoid is such a kind of "fool's life": "a kind of specious, often called" inevitable "fate, dominates people, people accumulate treasure in the ground, and they are bitten by insects, rusted, and thieves dig holes to steal. This is a fool's life." let's look at ourselves and ourselves Are the people around us living such a "fool's life"?
       <br><br>
What Thoreau wants to tell us in the economic chapter is: "once a man gets the necessities of life, he must choose something else, that is, to get rid of the humble labor and start a holiday. Move boldly to life. "

It amazes me that Henry David Thoreau was so profound, and that a book written in the 1850's can be drawn for reference and wisdom to help you in any situation in whatever context you find yourself struggling.

Consumerism is an industry of beauty, expressionism, movements, culture, status, and materialistic joy. It has given many people jobs, but can be dangerous without thinking of the consequences this ideology could be having. Although, I did not agree with the fashion industries offensive metaphor to monkeys. Taking more than needed is wasteful for the environment and for others.  One needs to evaluate their essential things. Generally, all houses have extra space filled with unused items never in cycle with our day to day needs. Whether it be a junk drawer, unnecessary supply closet, storage room, attic, garage with no space for a car, etc. Thoreau repeated argues that man has put himself in his own state of misery. Even though these hoarder habits seem harmless, its part of the material happiness sigma plaguing the population to view success as how big your carbon footprint is. The solution, "A Simple Life" has been eloquently spelled out to numerous times, delivered by authors, scientists, some politicians, education systems, etc. The minimalist strategy Henry David Thoreau fathered is radical for some, but if the population started to simplify, even slightly to get the ball rolling, the movement's effects would be very successful.

When reflecting on Thoreau's Walden in regards to humanities epidemic of the climate crisis, I think we should all remember the three golden rules preschool taught us… Play fair, clean up your own mess, and share everything. Arguably, everything morally important and the values to living a life well lived were bestowed upon us in preschool. Just like Mr. Thoreau's book, this proverb can be related to many of life's hardships and difficult situations. This climate crisis is so complex and many obstacles, governmentally and culturally, stand in our way. But at the end of the day, to heal these self-inflicted wounds, remember what it means to be a good human.

While reading "Walden" I immediately realized how different his life on the pond is to mine. If I'm being completely honest, the majority of my life and definitely my mental energy goes towards things that are not simple at all. I spend a lot of my time on my phone, either looking at pointless things on snapchat or other various material things. I think that the values Thoreau expresses in "Walden" are good to keep in mind because it is almost an undeniable fallacy that excess consumerism will bring one happiness. While often I am distracted by other things, I know that the days I begin by going to the beach are always the best for me. I think using "things" to make yourself happy is kind of like a drug in that they are easy to come by and devoid of virtue. One can buy something in a second but things like being in nature can only be achieved by actually doing it. Obviously some happiness is brought about by money, such as to a homeless person, but does spending lavish amounts of money vacationing all over the world bring much more happiness than just living at a pond? Probably not. Is it sustainable? Absolutely not.

<p>

Although I found Thoreau's "Walden" to admittedly be convoluted as others have previously mentioned, Thoreau still notably makes points that have surprisingly managed to stay relevant to this very date. Undoubtedly, he was ahead of his time. 

       <br><br>

What I found most interesting was the fact that Thoreau, as relatively wealthy as he was, could commit to a minimalist lifestyle for two years and be free from economic motivation. Thoreau had no desire to live in a huge mansion even if the opportunity to do so was presented. Today we see many celebrities and other wealthy people invest in houses that are unnecessarily big, especially considering the fact that most of them bear small families. This just goes to show that in today's society we don't want to settle for less when we could go for more, and although it is usually a good motto to follow, in this case, it is one of the biggest mistakes we have made. Why must we have what we want at the expense of what we absolutely need? 

       <br><br>

In addition to Thoreau's recommendation to live in small dwellings, he also makes many valuable points when he attacks the fashion industry and introduces his thoughts on consumerism. When Thoreau said "the head monkey of Paris puts on a travelers cap, and all the monkeys in America do the same," I felt that. We are all chained to the rhythm and must wear whatever is socially "acceptable" or trending. Designer products are a must in today's society. But the question remains, why would someone purchase multiple mediocre and costly items when, in accordance with Thoreau, one article of clothing with superior quality is just as good as three mediocre ones? We're just feeding our money to corporations and we couldn't be any dumber than to fail into their games. 
       <br><br>


I'm not saying we should go as far as to live in the wild and in isolation, but I do want to say that we don't always have to go for what we want and don't need, especially if it means putting the health of our planet at risk.

Although not very politically correct, Thoreau was very much ahead of his time. In many ways, he was, as Ken pointed out “the grandfather of the environmentalist movement.” I found the reading quite fascinating for a ton of reasons. The first of which was Thoreau’s commendable ability to genuinely uproot his life for a cause. As I’ve commented before, not many people live what they preach. The “moral laziness” always prevents action because it is simply too difficult to live one way for 20+ years then decide one day that you are going to live in a shed. That is why Thoreau argues that there aren’t any philosophers left. He says that back in the day, a philosopher would “live what they dictate'' and truly stick to their revelations. Whereas now, they become professors and lecture at people without making the requisite changes to their own lifestyle. That is why I have so much respect for Thoreau in this regard. However, some speculate that he would, on occasion, take breaks from living outdoors and go see his mom and have her do his laundry. Regardless, it takes a certain amount of will power to make such drastic personal changes. Even if I completely bought into Thoreau's argument, it is simply too much change all at once to move from my comfortable living to one where I have to work for every meal. In fact, it is incredibly hard to convince people to give up convenience. Even one of his primary points regarding shelter, he argues that it is more fulfilling to build your own house even if it is less perfect than it is to let an architect or carpenter do it for you. However, many people, including myself, are not very big fans of working with wood, and thus would have to inconvenience ourselves just to do a job that other people can do for us. In many ways, I think the division of labor has freed humanity of many inconveniences. If you are an artist, you don’t need to know how to code to use a computer, if you are a lawyer you don’t need to be an engineer to cross the bridge to work. We allow everyone to do their best at and due to our high population, every job gets done. I think Thoreau would answer that his commentary is aimed at those who are “idly discontented.” I think rather than producing a book meant to convert everyone to a sustainable lifestyle similar to his, he is simply showing that a. It is possible and b. If you are not currently happy with your situation, you can be happier without seeking more and more luxuries.

Thoreau described a self-sustaining life and one with less worries than today. He wrote as he tried to escape the life that most Americans followed in the 19th century, by living in the woods and have a minimal impact on the environment. He thought that by living a simple and minimal life will result in a richer experience and one that would be better for society. Today, people are fixated on working to buy the things that they want rather than just buying the things they need. However, people are too busy working and worrying about their problems that they cannot enjoy the fruits of their labor. Thoreau unknowingly gave us a solution to not only living a better stress-free life but one that is more sustainable than the one we are living. By only living with the bare necessities we are decreasing our CO2 consumption and cutting back our carbon footprint. Thoreau preached that people are working more than they should and fail to actually live life. Life is not meant to revolve around work. It should be carefree and be able to enjoy the present moment. We should only work for the things we need and live the rest without worries. Thoreau knew that a life filled with work and stress was not one that could be sustainable. I also think that Thoreau knew that one with luxuries and overconsumption is not one that the Earth can sustain.

After reading Chapter 1 of Walden by Henry David Thoreau, I have really enjoyed reading his text. Thoreau emphasizes that society is not the only place for human beings to live. I found his devotion towards the skepticism and doubts of how society works to be interesting. Conversely, Professor Hiltner’s approach that about Americans following the ‘norm’ or perhaps, the ‘joneses’ is a mere reflection of how humanity view one another. Everyone seemed to be following the herd and everyone seemed to be transitioning from the old and classic way of living to the new, prosperous lifestyle. Additionally, Thoreau endorses the idea of simplicity and solitude as he contemplates around the countryside about the idea of minimalism. The reading showcases that humanity doesn’t need more than their basic needs, the concept that consumerism is a self-destructive path to not only the individual, but to the world. Relating it back to climate change, the idea of minimalism is a great framework to build upon in reducing the carbon emission of our society, we do not need the emphasized, ‘extra’ or rather the ‘unnecessary’ things that are sure, often glamoring to an individual. I have discovered that as Thoreau explains, we are ‘slaving’ to work for things we do not need. Things we seek to fill a void, whether that be because of fame, monetary reasons, or just because you ‘want it’. We as society, need to be influenced by his concept of minimalist and slowly, shift to the lifestyle of simplicity. Doing so, we would eradicate the climate crisis.

I appreciate looking at Thoreau's life on Walden pond as a glance in a lifestyle that is alternative to the environmentally destructive one we are currently living. I do agree that complete lifestyle minimalism (what I see as a more doable version of zero waste that combines other important environmentally friendly actions like veganism, fossil-fuel free transportation and housing, etc.). However, I became more skeptical of Walden as the chapter progressed. This was not because I disagree with his lifestyle or that I don't think it is imperative that we all shift to a more Walden-esque life to be more environmentally friendly. I became more skeptical because of the messenger of this eco-friendly lifestyle and because of some important environmental considerations he left out. I think it is important to discover lifestyles that are starkly different to the ones we are currently living because it is destroying the planet. However, I don't like this class pretending that Walden invented minimalism or eco-friendly living. Even though Thoreau references different cultures (in such racist ways by calling them savages), he pretends that only he can compile the knowledge from all of them to create the perfect eco-friendly minimalist lifestyle. That is not true at all. Many different cultures have been living in eco-friendly ways for generations and generations and have not relied on Thoreau  to teach them how to do so. I would argue that different cultures practice environmentally-friendly living far better than Thoreau did--and in much more sustainable ways since Thoreau only lived this way for 5 years. I don't believe it was Ken's intention since he has mentioned other cultures living in more environmentally friendly ways, but making this our only reading on the topic makes it seem as if mirroring Thoreau's life is the only way to live if you don't want to destroy the planet. Not only is this problematic in the sense that it ignores all the different cultures who have been and who are currently practicing eco-friendly living in ways that I would argue are a lot better than Thoreau's, but it is also problematic because it gives people a false choice: either live in environmentally-destructive ways or copy Thoreau. This is not at all the case. It is indeed possible to live and eco-friendly lifestyle while still enjoying meaningful and satisfying relationships and hobbies. Environmental minimalism does not require that people do nothing, as Thoreau suggested. Environmental minimalism also does not mean depriving yourself of relationships. In fact, I would argue that having meaningful relationships makes environmentally friendly living easier. Humans require relationships and community. No matter how hard people try, it is impossible to live in solitude (or close to solitude since it seems as if the only people Thoreau interacted with were unimportant passerby's). Pretending that living alone in the middle of the woods is the only way to protect the planet will force a lot of people to choose living environmentally destructive lifestyles because they need community. This is not at all the case. I wish that the class was presented with another lifestyle that fulfills the human need for connection and community while still being eco-friendly--and there are definitely enough to pull from, you just need to look outside the "western world."

In the first chapter of “Walden,” Henry D. Thoreau explores the ideas of reform and how the pursuit of riches and goods are spiritually restraining. He leaves modern society and lives in a cabin by Walden Pond. At his stay there, he thinks about the materialism in society and how people are foolishly chasing after wealth and riches. In order to stray away from that materialistic mindset, Walden believes that people should live a more simple life (like he does at Walden) in order to  improve themselves.

       <br><br>

During and after reading Walden, I was a bit confused about Thoreau’s message because of how tedious the text was. I felt like instead of a book, this chapter was more like a sermon. However, I do think that this is great at conveying the benefits of living a minimalist life, which is greatly needed in today’s society. Even in Thoreau’s time, people were obsessed with consumerism and that obsession has only gotten worse as the years have gone by. Thoreau conveys that one can still be happy and be able to live with very little, and that was the significance of his “experiment” at Walden

In the readings, Thoreau introduces the reader to a simpler lifestyle where only the true necessities are kept. Thoreau mentions how the many things we want such as in fashion are placed in our head by society. Out dated clothes makes us want to buy more clothes to stay on trend. Many times the clothes we no longer want are in perfect conditions, but we have fallen for society’s trap where we no longer seem to value them. This mentality is placed there by fashion industries which make us want to stay up to date even though it really isn’t necessary. 
       <br><br>

The reading really made me ponder about the saying “money does not bring happiness”. Many people aspire to be financially successful in order to be able to buy everything they never had. But this mentality just crowds our life’s. A simpler life style would really push us to make the most of what we really do not have in life and thats time. Time really does fly by and we have to make the most out of it. Not following fashion tends, or wanting to have more but spending that time creating memories. Because memories are not only present when we are living, but they are the only things that also stays here when we are gone.

Henry Davd Thoreau’s “Walden” was definitely not a light easy straightforward read. I was genuinely lost on his point for the first bit, but then eventually caught on. I honestly had no idea that the concept of minimalism or simplicity was so old. When I found out that the book was written in the 1800’s it obviously explained the writing, but the thoughts and content are still so relevant today. I think it is very interesting that we have been struggling with the same issues for so long and it is so thought provoking to read first accounts of people who lived luxurious lives only to choose a minimalistic one. Really puts into perspective how big time and world is and that the earth will hopefully be here way beyond us as it has been way before us. 

       <br><br>

We as a population need to make huge cutbacks on our consumption. I think Thoreau takes an extremist approach to what we now call minimalism, which is great, but I think giving people grace to find a medium will be the most efficient way to start a movement and welcome people to be a part of it. The quote “He has no time to be anything but a machine,” really stood out to me again just because it is so relevant to today and it blows my mind that even when we aren’t working, we aren’t really being on earth. Rather we are consumed with our phones or televisions. I believe that this is a cliche criticism of humanity for a reason, because it has been an issue for such an absurd amount of time. The reason I am not a huge consumer is not because I have a better perspective on the world than other people, but because I grew up poor, so we just couldn’t afford to have tons of stuff. I notice now that I have a lack of concern for the clothes I own or for having the newest phone while everyone else is obsessed because I never had the newest shiniest thing growing up. I am very guilty of participating in mass consumption and technological addiction, but it is interesting to see in my own life that we really do have power over our environment and the kind of mentality we can have as people and consumers. Ultimately our dollar does have power to do harm to ourselves and our environment.

It also took me a few rereads to grasp what Thoreau was trying to say, but once I caught on I felt inspired by his minimalistic lifestyle. I also think that he takes it to a bit of an extreme, and extreme that would near impossible to do in our society simply because of where our things come from (food almost always comes in packaging, phones are necessary despite the amount of resources/energy they use, etc). Yet I whole-heartedly believe that there is an inner peace that can come to a person living a minimalistic life. My favorite quote from this chapter of "Walden" has to be in reference to luxury versus comfort: "Kings and queens who wear a suit but once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to their majesties, cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits." I found this to be incredibly poetic, and obviously applicable to more than just clothes. There is a genuine wholesomeness that comes from letting go of one's obsession to have more, and cutbacks on consumption would save not only our planet but improve overall wellbeing.

Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden” was a tough read, I’d agree. I’ve read some of his other works in the past and they were also a struggle. I alway knew people hundreds of years ago lived a simpler life than us now but I didn’t know minimalism was a thing during the nineteenth century. It’s interesting that we face some of the same issues people faced two hundred years ago, but it’s sad that these issues haven’t been addressed sooner. I’d agree with you, Claire, that our consumption levels are out of control. We live in a country where materialism and material items give people status. Celebrities like Kylie Jenner posts about their new cars, new shoes, or thousand dollar birthday parties, which makes the rest of the world want what they have. I agree that we do need to cut back on our mindless consumption and think before we buy. 
       <br><br>

Thoreau lived a simple life, appreciating nature. He is an extreme minimalist. I don’t expect people to live like him but moving towards his direction and ideas would be a healthy start. I think a lot of the time we are just cheerful robots, going along with societal norms. We live doing mindless work and living as society expects us to (our social roles). I think this is what Thoreau is talking about when he states “He has no time to be anything but a machine.” 
       <br><br>

I, unfortunately, am someone who participates in consumerism. I always want the newest and trendiest items. I don’t think about the effects of my purchases, especially my clothing purchases. Every year I clear out my closet, getting rid of anything I don’t see wearing again. I know I need to watch myself and my purchases as well as not own so much.

Everything always seems to come back to Thoreau and that is because he was ahead of his time. As I read this I think what a great piece and boy did I not appreciate this piece in high school. Thoreau was a wealthy man who realized common norms of people. “I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of,” he writes. People were quite literally working to be out of debt. Why be in the debt in the first place when you don’t need a giant house or the newest fashions. Why should they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born? People were like that then and they are still like this now. 

       <br><br>

Thoreau notices that people are selling to live and he wanted to do the opposite of that. People aren’t really living life because they are not in nature being self sufficient. He says, if you hurt your leg, you mend it. But if peoples’ pants are ripped, people just get a new pair because why the heck not. People were not living on the necessities of life; food, shelter, and clothing. And that is what he challenged himself to do.

       <br><br>

Honestly, I quite envy the whole working with nature, being self sufficient, and not having extra stress of life and commodities. I think Thoreau would be upset with today’s society because it hasn’t changed… or rather, he wouldn’t be surprised. Who knows though, if I could ask him, I would.

Reading Walden's introduction clarified the way in which a normal person can take on the massive challenge of climate change in terms of lifestyle changes. It revealed that beneath all the complexities of recyclables and luxuries and decorations and lifestyle improvements are two directions a human can take: simplicity, or complexity.
       <br><br>


Walden made me think about why humans today seem to tend toward lifestyle complexity by default. When the average person thinks of success they think of a bigger house, more clothes, a better computer, fancier food, a bigger phone. Why is this? Why is material complexity linked to success and growth? Can we change this connection in our brains? If we could, that would make a profoundly positive impact on the climate crisis.

       <br><br>

What came to mind was the difference and connection between internal and external complexity. To me, internal complexity means the knowledge of one's place in the greater picture of things, knowledge of one's desires and goals in the grand scheme of the human race, knowledge of one's hypocrisies and biases. External complexity, meanwhile, is the complexity of material goods and lifestyle: the desire for a better car, a bigger house, nicer clothes. It seems to me that internal and external complexity are necessarily inversely related, that our culture's emphasis on increasing external complexity comes from a lack of internal complexity. Walden seems to prove this to me, seeing as Thoreau derived gratification and fulfillment from as simple an external life as possible because of his heightened knowledge of his intense internal life, of his appreciation for what little he had brought about by the heightened understanding of the basic physical needs of the human race. His heightened internal complexity allowed for external simplicity. 

       <br><br>

To me, the human race will always derive success and gratification from increased complexity in one way or another, whether that be scientific progress, increased emotional understanding, or more material goods. I assert that, in order for our lifestyles to be sustainable, we must change our current means of gratification from external complexity to internal complexity, that instead of progressing in material goods, we progress in understanding and knowledge of the world and ourselves and our place in that world. Walden is proof that gratification can come from internal complexity if one just commits themselves to that drastic change.

"the more things you have the poorer you are." This line from Walden jumped out at me and slapped me in the face. It's finally starting to set in how insane we are for valuing materials over real feelings, emotions, connections, and relationships. If we work hard we should be working hard for ourselves because we want to achieve a goal, not to make money to buy a car or house or anything. When we die we can't take ANY thing with us, and what we leave behind is a legacy based on relationships with family, friends, our communities, and the environment. Having an abundance of 'things' will never satisfy all the needs or the emotions that humans are capable of feeling. What really makes someone 'rich' is their character. Of course what Thoreau explains in "Walden" about his cabin which, "consisted of a bed, a table, a desk, three chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of tongs and andirons, a kettle, a skillet, and a frying-pan, a dipper, a wash-bowl, two knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for molasses, and a japanned lamp." is very extreme and basically only fulfills his 'needs' to survive. There is a difference between needs and wants, and we can still indulge and live beyond survival but there needs to be a reteaching. What we should want and look forward to doing in our free time isn't shopping it should be learning hobbies, spending time with family, cooking, growing a garden, swimming in the ocean, and a number of other things that will make humans truly feel joy as well as the concept of 'living in the moment'.

Amid the rat race that is society today, the idea of going into the wilderness to discover what is truly meaningful is very compelling. In today’s world, people are bogged down by a surplus of meaningless things - although it is argued that consumerism and capitalism has made life more convenient, it has also made life infinitely more complicated. It’s no surprise that people are intrigued by Thoreau’s simplistic life by Walden Pond. Before reading Walden, I was enamoured by the book Into the Wild, written about the life of Christopher McCandless (who was also inspired by Walden). Like Thoreau, McCandless wanted to escape the buzz of urban civilization and seek refuge in nature; although McCandless ultimately died in the wilderness, I found it interesting that he was happier overall living away from all of society’s comforts. 
       <br><br>
Thoreau makes many convincing points about going back to nature, and I agree that his lifestyle would lead to happier and more peaceful states of mind. However, it is a hard thing to achieve in current times. What we can instead do is try to live more simplistically and make conscious and moral choices as consumers about the products we buy. It is not necessary to continue contributing to capitalism; instead, living a more minimalist life should be something we all strive for, not only because it would lead to more peaceful lives but also because it’s a step forward in reducing our carbon footprints. Thoreau conveys this well with his quote, “Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.” The finer fruits of life aren’t the material goods or products of consumerism that we think will make us happier. Being able to buy bigger and more expensive items shouldn’t be the marker of happiness and success, but rather finding contentment in life’s simple pleasures.

After reading “Walden”, I found myself in an abnormal mood about my desires, my stressful lifestyle, and my goals. I thought to myself, “what does it mean to pursue all these meaningless desires?” 
       <br><br>

Thoreau’s piece on the benefits of minimalist culture and the evils of society struck something in me that goes beyond words. When I think about it, I've never pictured myself anywhere else but in large cities, busy towns, and scrambling nations. Living a day without pursuing any luxuries, doing anything to extinguish my desires, or mindlessly consuming never would feel like a normal day for me, as it has been all I've ever learned to do. It was so surprising to hear when Thoreau brought up the conversation of slavery, and drew a parallel to today. He insisted that we are enslaving ourselves, saying “It is hard to have a Southern overseer; it is worse to have a Northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself.”
       <br><br>

From reading “Walden” I grew a distaste for human consumption and mechanized culture, and grew a desire for a simple life. A life without the pressures of others, the stress of work/school, and everyday life sounded like something that would not only benefit me, but so many other people. I would argue that only living by bare necessities (water, food, clothes, shelter) would not only be something that would increase satisfaction in people's lives, but lessen the impact we have on our earth. Although a great idea, it is sad to come to terms with this lifestyle not happening for the majority of people on this earth, as we are too busy chasing our luxuries.

Upon reading "Walden", I also found myself questioning the way I live my life. Just as you stated, I also looked at what I deem is important to me and what society overall deems important and it really made me think. In reality, how do all these meaningless things affect our quality of life? We live in a capitalistic, throw-away society and that leads to waste. Not only is this bad for the environment, but this consumerism also has negative effects on our state of mind. One thing I found that I could relate this to is Buddhism. From doing a bit of research on Buddhism in high school english class, I learned that one main ideal of this ideology is that you cannot be happy if you are constantly wanting for things. Once you no longer want, you are able to feel content. That's why I think that this ideal that is brought up in "Walden" and that you mention here is so important. We are made slaves to consumerism and this wasteful culture because we are trained to believe this is what will make us content. We are taught the bigger the better and this will fill our desires and make us happy when in reality, all it does is increase our appetite for more. From reading this, I also saw human consumption as repulsive. Not only can we reduce the negative impact we have on the planet, but by living a simpler life and wanting for less, we can reduce the negative impact on our souls.

When it came to reading "Walden," it further deepened my sadness of the way Americans live today. This is something that hadn't crossed my mind much before taking this class. Yes, I knew people had wildly lavish lifestyles, but I just kind of assumed that was how it was. What I hadn't put together was the fact that it's everyone's lifestyles that are constantly changing to fit the bigger, better idea that has somehow engrained itself in the brain of all Americans. We don't live the same way as the rest of the world. The consumer culture is real, and to Thoreau's disappointment, I don't think it's going anywhere. There would need to be a mass deployment of information such as the information in this course to cause enough people to want to change their lifestyle for the climate. I honestly can't imagine America without the consumer culture, it's unfortunately become part of our identity.

As for being vegetarian, the arguments made about how it's evolutionary that humans eat animals is interesting, and another thing I hadn't thought much of before. I'm personally not a vegetarian, I just don't eat red meat, and have been doing that for quite a while now. Since taking this class especially, I've toyed with the idea of going full vegetarian or even vegan, and it does seem like a daunting task. That being said, I think I could do it. An advantage we have now is we have so many more types of meat supplements, or other ways of getting protein and calories without necessarily eating meat, and that's definitely a newer innovation. I'm not sure which would do more for the environment if everyone went vegetarian or everyone became a minimalist, but I do think to each their own on what they can do to help the environment.

Thoreau’s ideologies are one of the few ideologies which can lead to a happy and less environmentally destructive life if an individual believes in them. According to Thoreau, a simple life would be much satisfying than our lavish lifestyle. Our culture is much dependent on buying various things, which we might only get a chance of utilizing them for a short time before we deem them as “inappropriate” such as fashion. Individuals in the current generation do not prefer utilizing goods for a long time but believe that the best life involves the acquisition of many amenities 0 and utilizing a few times compared to their intended lifetime. The majority of tailor’s weave clothes to last long but individuals prefer wearing them on very few occasions before throwing them out hence leading to wastage of resources and energy. Thoreau’s work would have received so much criticism in the current generation because individuals prefer showing off what they have rather than what they need. The urge to attain more than we need leads to various destructive activities both on the environment and the world as a whole. However, if individuals could accept Thoreau's ideology, they would realize that the majority of things individuals stress are irrelevant and do not add up any health or psychological benefit. An individual should find happiness in a simple life rather than depend on other people's opinions concerning how an individual should live and the things they require in their “scripted” life

While several commenters have raised the question of relevancy in regards to this chapter's connection to the course, I think the questions regarding consumerism and materialism are fundamental to the climate crisis. The majority of our previous readings have dealt with the science and politics of climate change but Thoreau talks personally about his lifestyle and choices while connecting it to broader points about problems he observed in society. However, his critiques regarding the dependence of people on material goods and pursuit of lifestyles based around pleasure and lavishness instead of necessity are directly applicable to the climate crisis because it deals with the fundamental societal factors that are responsible for this crisis. 
       <br><br>
One part of the chapter that I think is particularly thought-provoking is when Thoreau discusses an anecdote about an Indian man selling baskets to a lawyer, questioning the role of power dynamics in our capitalist economy. In all honesty, when I first read this part of the chapter I didn't understand the purpose of its inclusion and it took me several times of reading it over to understand how the small paragraph carries a lot of meaning and reveals Thoreau's insights on how he views the capitalist system. The primary purpose of the anecdote is to question why people value certain types of work, in this case basket weaving, less than others, such as being a lawyer. Thoreau raises this question by asking "why should we exaggerate any one kind [of work] at the expense of others." While this is not directly related to climate change, it is undeniable that a major contributing factor to the release of fossil fuels is a basic notion in our society that success in business and the accumulation of wealth is to be valued above all else. As we discussed in the first couple lectures, the vast majority of the climate crisis is due to the actions of the U.S. and a handful of other developed nations, where this mindset is widespread and perpetuated by our culture. Additionally, this mindset regarding what type of success is more valuable can contribute to how people justify the continued use of fossil fuels, since people in developed countries believe their success is more important than what is happening in developing countries and the well-being of other people and the environment on a global scale.

I also agree with you that we should unite together as a community to tackle the climate crisis rather than blaming past generations or expecting future generations. In Walden, Thoreau provokes a whole new ideology of lifestyle—minimalism, in which that the things we need are“food, shelter, clothing, and fuel.” He brings up a different opinion of the way we should live instead of chasing those luxuries that may, in return, causing tons of burden and pressure. Living in a small cabin with the least amount of things is his success in simplifying his life and also finding his happiness. He records his life in a journal and provides his findings through the observance of nature. Besides, self-reliance is the central theme of Walden, which he was able to survive on little things and money and was able to enhance his spiritual values. 
       <br><br>
 Education and responsiveness are essential aspects of the climate crisis. The knowledge we gain from school or any information we get from the media should be well-organized and well-phrased. The issue is that we should recognize the intrinsic value rather than economic value, and the materialism and consuming world we have today complicate the process of being environmentally friendly. Besides, I agree with you that many people are greedy, which they see money, power, and social status over everyone else life.

I have read Walden already, but re-reading it with the perspective I have now made things pop out and made me realize things I didn't previously think about the first time I read it.  I agree with Hiltner's statement when he said that at some point in everyone's life they need to go out and experience and connect with nature.  I think a lot of people, especially in America, are very disconnected from the natural world as they don't have the time to since most people seem to be caught up in the pursuit for more; more money to buy more material possessions.  As a teen, these material possessions are things like more clothes, the newest iPhone, or a car when you get your license.  Once you're older these things become a new house, or another new car (since people always seem to need to have the newest and best "things").  I like Thoreaus perspective on minimalism and living from the land, and that humans only need 4 fundamental things; food, shelter, clothing, and fuel, however, I think that Walden takes these ideals to the extreme, and I don't think that most of the American population could do the same; I don't think the average American has the means to build their own house, get rid of their car, or purge themselves of all materialistic conventions.  However, I do think it is a good reminder on how to live, and that it is a good reminder to focus on the things we need, before the things that we want.  I watched a movie on Netflix called "Minimalism," and I remember seeing that the people who lived the simplest of lives with only the things they need seemed to be the happiest and the most content with how they existed in the world.  I always feel like I am at my happiest when I am in nature with only the things I need-which for me is surfing.  I find I truly feel the most content with life when all I have is my surfboard, wetsuit, and a nice sunny day with good waves.

The type of living described by Thoreau is very simplistic in nature and is a very good supplement to the ideals of this course. If current-day consumers agreed to live a life similar to Thoreau without the luxuries that are often times CO2 emitting. Fighting against consumerism is a very difficult task in the modern world as many are addicted to materialistic things.
        <br><br>
Another idea mentioned that would combat current-day CO2 levels is the decision to not eat meat. This decision is not a cookie-cutter idea though; many people can combat CO2 emissions through small efforts such as replacing chicken with beef or simply choosing to have a plant-based diet on certain days of the week.

After reading walden I found myself in


</p><hr>


<p>
I do think that Thoreau was “on to something” so to speak. And I think that if he saw how some Americans live today, he would be astounded, and probably disgusted. While I was reading, I found myself rolling my eyes, and I felt bad about it. I mean, yes, most Americans have too many things. For example, I probably don’t need five scented candles -- one is enough. But to think that we all need to live in a garden shed just seems drastic. Living a minimalist lifestyle (which I do highly respect by the way) is also pretty drastic. Of course, we don’t need as much stuff as we have, but I still want to be comfortable. I don’t think it’s so awful to have an extra blanket, or two fancy dresses for special occasions, for example. But the more I analyze the way I feel, the more I am able to see my hypocrisy. 


        <br><br>


For example, I think we should all be able to give up meat. Yes, it tastes good, but it’s just so completely and utterly not worth it. My hypocrisy lies in the fact that other people feel about meat the way I feel about my clothes -- it’s just not something they’re willing to give up. They value it as something that is necessary to live a good quality of life. A similar argument could be made with cars. I don’t own a car right now, but in the future when I do, I will be completely happy with the cheapest thing I can find on the market. Other people love cars, and feel they need a particular brand or model in order to be happy with it. Our possessions that should only be for necessity have become hobbies. I love scented candles so I want one for every season, but if they were all taken away, I would probably get over it pretty quickly. I guess we have to realize that we need certain things because we got used to needing them. This is what makes Thoreau’s experience so interesting. He did something most people aren’t willing to do: he gave up his quality of life long enough to realize it wasn’t the answer.

After I read the chapter 1 and finish watch the documentary of minimalism, I realized the true story behind it that big companies want you to buy more so they create the false equation that more staff equal to more happiness and high social status. In all our life, we tend to follow this mainstream concept and believe it since everyone else does the same thing. We did not pause a moment and think about that does this equation really correct? Do I really need that much stuff? Am I really getting happier when I have more stuff? According to research, when a person make more than $70,000 a year, money no longer buy happiness. I read someone in the comment said " people always say college life is the happiest, will the reason be we do not have much stuff?" I really like his idea that when we have less stuff, we worry less. And when we worry less, we get happier. Why would we keep things that bring us chaos, tiredness and vanity? A stuff that we might not use for years. Think about the sweater you have not been wear for 3 months, does that thing really make you happier? How about the money you paid for that? Because that is really money. Warren Buffet offer a suggestion that " You list 25 things that you think are most important for your life at first, then you choose 5 things that are even more important then you should cross out the rest 20 on your list and focus on the 5 things only." In our lifestyle, it is the same, only focus on the real important one.

The first chapter of "Walden: Economy" confused me at first since it seems to have no connection with this course. However, as I moved on reading I realize that it is actually related to our assignment from last week. The reading mention that people currently are pursuing too much on rich, or on things can be bought by money. They overwhelmingly want to compete with their friends and people around them. Nevertheless, win in this kind of competition in fact cannot provide them happiness. It is very important for our generation that we have to realize that materialism, or consumerism is not a right thing to keep going and we have to start figuring out a way to save our Earth, starting from now. "Minimalism" might seems to be a terrible idea at the first thought, but if we really dig deep into it and try to implement it in our daily life, there is a huge probability that we will find out it is not as horrible as we thought it will be. And it can even benefit the environment. So instead of pursuing on the fake 'pleasure' given by luxuries. Maybe people now should reflect a little bit more on what truly will provide them real happiness and which will not cause climate crisis.

While reading David Thoreau's 1854 Walden, I came across a phrase that really hit me. "Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private opinion." I feel that the purpose of this reading was to let us know that we are the only ones to blame for our actions and that most people don't care what you do so there really is no need to impress others just to get a small sense of satisfaction. The chapter was stating that although people live such a luxurious life and seem to be happy, "the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation" and that "men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other." This ties into the American Dream and how people wanted to live private lives and work to desperately obtain luxuries that others do not have. It's crazy to imagine that Thoreau had such a simplistic, yet precise imagination of what we had to do to live a sustainable life back in his days because the standard of living today is no where near his ideology of a simplistic and natural lifestyle. I was thinking back to when Ken was apologizing to us in his lecture videos when Thoreau stated, "the old have no very important advice to give the young, their own experience has been so partial and their lives have been such failures" and it made me laugh because if he were alive today then he would be repulsed at what we have made for ourselves. I feel that as we progress as a species, we grow accustomed to the things we have today and reverting back to older times is not going to be an easy thing to do especially if it means giving up our belongings and machines.

I believe you selected a very interesting quote from the reading. I too believe that Thoreau made a valuable point about the useless nature of relying on public opinion as opposed to our own. At the end of the day, the most important opinion should be your own because too many people within our current society rely on material things to signify someone's societal status, rather than relying on the substance of someone's character. Even though I do think Thoreau makes valuable points within "Walden," I do not think that everything he says should be taken literally, seeing as our current world is not what it was during the time when he was alive. I do believe that it is important for us to revert back to living simple lives in the sense that we do not overly consume products. Meaning that we should live more minimalistic lives instead of what Thoreau suggests, which is that we isolate ourselves and live simple lives immersed in nature. I think Thoreau's suggestion is simply improbable with how advanced our current society is.

Something interesting that I felt Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" revealed to me was that the climate crisis can be vastly impacted on an individual level as much as a large scale level. While we push for large environmental change on a political level I feel we brush aside the impact we could be having on the climate crisis with change on an individual level. Henry Thoreau attempted to live the most complacent earth sourced lifestyle he could to find the deeper meanings to life. In doing so he also lives a great lifestyle of minimalism not driven by social trends. While this may be the perfect lifestyle, that if we all lived today would possibly mitigate the effects of climate change, however, it isn't realistic in today's generation. This doesn't mean there is no use that can be taken from this book, it just needs to be interpreted to be a plausible lifestyle for the masses of today. The greatest thing we can take and adapt to our lifestyles from this piece I feel is ignoring the trends of society whether they be fashion, technology or automotive. As it has become easier to source goods to users through mass stores like Amazon trends tend to spread like wildfire and in my experience, I feel that trends have continuously shortened in length of existence as of recent. With these trends comes tons of waste whether it be in the old-style clothing or last generation iPhones and pollution from mass production facilities and inhumanly treated workforces running these factories. As a younger generation, I feel it is up to us to kill the fad of trends or just lessen and find complacency from the things we have and people around us rather than the next ad that pops up on our screen.

Although written over 150 years ago, Thoreau's ideas from Walden are more applicable than ever today. Unfortunately, society, especially in America, has moved in the exact opposite direction that Walden would have wanted it to. The consumerism boom in the 1950's would have Thoreau turning in his grave. I find it very unfortunate that humankind progressed in the way it did. This sounds excessively broad and downright strange but I think society could have moved in an entirely different direction than it did. If religions like Buddhism spread as prolifically as Christianity then the norm that material possessions determine status would never have been created. People would have been able to feel satisfied with things other than just the accumulation of physical signs of wealth. I know this sounds very abstract but I think you can trace all of today's problems back this far. 
        <br><br>
With every passing day it seems as if people become more and more focused on materialism on social status and ironically their pursuit of these things almost inevitably bring along higher rates of depression and anxiety. This lifestyle is not sustainable because people will never feel fully content once they acquire the material goods that they once sought so desperately. If people solely base their fulfillment on this they will never feel true peace. People with this mentality struggle to be happy because even once they satisfy their goals of acquiring what they want, the cycle restarts and they pursue more goods that they think will bring them happiness. Thoreau's ideas of minimalism seem a lot more conducive to happiness than the worldview held by most people today but we seem almost too far gone. It would be so difficult for society, especially in America, to revert to a system where social hierarchy is not based on material wealth. Thoreau's perspective on climate change would likely be quite similar to Ken's in that both understand that cultural/lifestyle changes are the only way to prevent further damage to the environment. I aim to change my life towards a direction more focused on minimalism.

I think about Walden almost every day and I find Thoreau's ideas to be amazingly relevant today. We must be critical of our consumer culture to stop climate change. We have to change our habits and values in ways that will be radical for some. Thoreau emphasizes the importance of questioning the norms passed onto us by former generations. In our case, that is a certain standard of living that calls for unnecessary energy and material consumption. Thoreau is not necessarily suggesting his life at walden pond as the ideal life for everyone, he is more urging the reader to reflect on their life and where there is room for improvement. His points are incredibly relevant for being written over 100 years ago. This speaks to how deeply rooted out habits are. One of my favorite parts of the first chapter is when Thoreau says he is not speaking to those "well employed," but to the "mass of men who are discontented." This calls for reflection and leaves room for the reader to decide which group they are in. Unfortunately, for all that we consume, many of us are not happy and we are constantly disatisfied with what we have. As far as solving the climate crisis, education falls short where people don't go farther and reflect on their lives and habits. Deep reflection is ultimately what Thoreau is suggesting and I believe it leads to a deeper feeling of connection to the world around us which is essential for solving the climate crisis.

Living lavish has become the set goal for society for many years now. If it was difficult before to convince the last generation to live a more simple life. A simple life with less meat, less splendid houses and less abundant clothing, it will be even more difficult now. My generation is greatly influenced to reach for a better and more lavish life that at any opportunity to buy something new many times we do. Trends are evolving and passing through quicker than before. What was in style last month is no longer in this month. Trying to keep up is costing us more than just money. 
            <br><br>
  People were so surprised with his decision to shift from a mechanized life to a life away from that. I can not imagine how people would react today. We have become so dependent in a life with technology that many are incompetant of even going one day without it. He lived his life making things from scratch, while we are used to buying things already made for us. He even made part of his furniture. Most of us do not even know how to make furniture all we do is take a quick trip to the store.  That is a life that is going to take a lot getting used to.

The reading of "Walden" was definitely different than anything I have ever read before. It was honestly a bit hard to understand but for the most part I understood what Thoreau was trying to get across. He wanted people to go back to simpler times, where all they really had was them and nature. I could understand why Ken would want us to read this now because as fast fashion and cars take over the world their impact on the environment is incredibly detrimental.

After reading chapter 1 of Henry David Thoreau's Walden and listening to Ken's lecture on its broader message, its extremely obvious that we as a society are doing exactly the opposite of what Thoreau argues. The idea of living simply is an age-old idea, and up until very recently its been a core part of many cultures around the world. Since many countries look to the West in their transitions into 21st century economies, the US and Europe are responsible for the idea that having more things means you will be happier. 100 years ago, this idea was at its peak in the 1920's, dubbed the roaring 20's for its clear emphasis on living lavishly and freely, unaware of any consequences. Ironically, the following decade, the 1930's, was the Dust Bowl and Great Depression, one of the worst recessions/depressions that the United States has ever seen. The generation of the 20's was able to live like kings, but those born into the 30's were born into a time of extreme poverty and loss of hope for living a better life. In a sense, that is exactly what will happen to us as a society. The previous generations were able to live prosperous lives and were able to achieve things that they never had even dream of. In parallel, the current generation is the the beginning of the 30's, being placed into a situation where impending doom is on its way, and its up to us to make something of it. 
            <br><br>


I think Thoreau's challenge of living simply is based on the idea to appreciate everything we have for what it is, and that can only be done through a cultural and generational shift. No longer is the idea to "achieve the american dream" where one can live a prosperous, consumer life, but instead it needs to be a dream of living a meaningful life, full of purpose and value for what it is. Often the purpose and value in our lives is in front of us, but the consumer culture has blinded us and detracted the focus so that we are unable to see it. Thoreau puts this beautifully through his analogy of eating soley vegetables, to which his neighbor argues is insufficient and proceeds to work with his oxen, an animal known for its strength and lives on a mostly plant based diet.

Henry David Thoreau's expression of minimalistic ideas are strongly compelling and very truthful. Many people feel trapped in their lives as they struggle to conform to social, cultural or familial norms, and leading a less materialistic or more independent life can remove some of these feelings of entrapment. This work is perhaps even more relevant in the modern era than it was in the past. I loved Thoreau’s line “What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may turn out to be falsehood to-morrow” as its relevance to the climate crisis is stunning. In the past, the emissions of fossil fuels has been echoed as the one true way to advance our world, yet now individuals are finally beginning to realize the falsehood of this lifestyle. In a similar aspect, Thoreau’s points about the capitalistic society with live in resonate in todays society, as factories, shipping and material production, as well as non-reusable products create massive amounts of unnecessary waste.
            <br><br>
Similarly, I liked Thoreau’s expression of the farmer who states that bones can not be made with only plants, yet follows an animal much stronger whose bones are solely made with plants. This point holds relevance in todays culture, as many are unwilling to give up meat due to their belief that they will not be as healthy if they lived solely off of plants, while others demonstrate it is entirely possible. Overall Thoreau reminds me of John Muir, living a simple life close to nature, and a minimalist life. I all the more loved his explanation of the cost of travel, and how to walk thirty miles on foot in his time took the same time as to drive the distance, if one accounted for the amount of work one would have to do in order to have the money for fuel to go that same distance.
            <br><br>
His description of how “the savages” all owned their homes, and yet 50% people in so called “civilized” areas did not, is even more relevant today than in Thoreau’s time, with individuals leasing homes, renting them, and buying them over long periods of time to the extent that few Americans actually own their home. This is a sad truth, as many individuals wander into debt to have the appearance of wealth. The take out loans for cars, for homes for school, just about anything they can take out a loan for they do. The world we live in would shock and nauseate Thoreau, and I myself am ashamed to say I contribute to this world. I believe Thoreau's points are strong and that we should indeed "simplify" our lives. Have lived and worked a simplistic lifestyle before, I can attest that is indeed a much happier way of life than life in a city workspace.

Henry David Thoreau made a lot of good points in the first chapter of Walden. He begins by saying that we cannot compare our standards to the generations before us, and hold our standard of living to theirs, as we are always learning to be more efficient. This is applicable to today as well, since we have learned in this class that this generation cannot live at the same standard as the previous generations with large houses, cars, and spending lots of money on materialistic things. We have to be conscious of our choices and be better in our decisions. He also made a good point when he reminded the readers that the necessity of clothing is to keep us warm and to make sure we are not naked, and everything besides that is somewhat irrelevant. This point still stands today, especially with our fast fashion industry, pumping out clothes for what is in style, and will not be in merely months. I think if we often remind ourselves why we need clothes (for warmth and not to be exposed), then we will be able to make smarter choices when buying clothes by thrifting and rewearing clothes even if they are not trending at the moment. Eventually, all styles will go out of the trend and we will laugh at the old trends. Thus, this fast fashion industry will never stop unless we as the consumers slow down and realize the constant cycle we are tricked into buying and throwing old clothes.
            <br><br>
Additionally, Thoreau highlights how people will waste their lives to rent/buy luxurious housing, when smaller and more simple housing provides the same necessities. He even noted how the housing that Native Americans used provided the same amount of warmth and comfort that fancier housing does. This again, is still relevant to today, as we realize that smaller houses and apartments are not only comfortable enough to live in, but also help the environment overall when compared to larger houses that many people in America live in. It is amazing how many of the points Thoreau makes are applicable to this class and generation as a whole, and we can learn from his points to live more meaningful lives and focus less on what is deemed successful and more on what makes our living conditions sustainable so we can focus on greater things outside of materialism.

When I found out this week’s comments was on minimalism, I was not surprised that this week’s reading was by Henry David Thoreau. I remember reading Thoreau in high school and the only thing I can recall was reading that he lived in the woods for a period of time.
            <br><br>

Reading “Walden” made me realize how relevant Thoreau’s work is today. It is incredible that Thoreau knew so much about society in the 1800’s, yet people still have not caught on. He is right, people are too attached to materialistic items. People today are overworking to support their extravagant lifestyles. What people fail to realize is that there are other ways to live. If you live your life minimally with the bare necessities, life becomes purer and less chaotic. This way of living is even more appropriate in today’s society because of climate change and reducing our carbon footprint. I agreed with Thoreau when he said, “He has no time to be anything but a machine.” Today, the American lifestyle is money driven. People are always looking for the next bigger and better thing to seek. Whether its cars, clothes, or homes, Americans want more and more. As technology improves, this cycle will only continue. More people need to read and learn from Thoreau’s work. Our planet depends on it.

After reading the first chapter of Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" I believe that his views are extremely relevant today. There have been countless modern studies that have shown that these consumerist ideals of gaining more and more "stuff," not only does not make people happier, but may even make their lives worse. I feel that it is important to acknowledge that this is only true to a certain extent. People in poverty of course would have a better quality of life if they were no longer in poverty, however after people are at the point of having all of their basic needs met, studies have shown that overall quality of life is not usually much different. This is why Thoreau's experiment in Walden is so relevant. I feel like people, especially Americans, today are constantly taking for granted everything that we use on a daily basis and it has come to the point that the line between necessity and not is very blurry. Thoreau is definitely on to something here, not only because it would be extremely helpful to our environment, but also because it would improve our individual lives. We should all try to implement at least some of these ideals into our everyday lives, because it's really not that difficult.

Minimalism is one of many things that has been around for a long time but feels relatively new due to its current resurfacing (like the term YOLO, or the selfie). I think that one of the best ways to bring around healthy habits nowadays are to bring them around by embracing their modern twists. The climate crisis has gotten so bad that at this point, Thoreau's take on minimalism is not actually a viable solution. If everyone decided to move out into the woods, then the progress that we have been making towards sustainable cities would be lost, and all the land we are trying to protect would become populated. However, a better take on minimalism is on the rise, and it all started with Thoreau spreading the word on it so long ago (side note: I do find the tone of his writing somewhat condescending at points; the encouragement to pursue his lifestyle is communicated as pity for those who choose not to). Minimalism is becoming more and more of a trend, which is what we need. Social media is proving to be the greatest tool in spreading it. For example, there are several accounts on instagram that are solely popular due to the idea of a perfect #vanlife that the owners of the account are spreading through filters and their attractiveness. Although I find it cringe-worthy, if that's what it takes to get people excited about living tiny, then so be it. Thoreau set an example for others by living the life that he asked others to pursue. Social media influencers and celebrities have the chance to be modern Thoreaus. Leonardo DiCaprio is working towards that by living vegan, for example. However, others need to follow suit, and in bigger ways. My favorite band, Milky Chance, recently announced their goal to become entirely sustainable to set an example for the music industry. As someone who looks up to them, I feel encouraged to follow their example. If other celebrities walked the talk, their positions as role models for millions would have an enormous impact (and they would get to be modern-day Thoreaus!).

To be honest, I had a hard time comprehending the details of the reading. It used a lot of complex comparisons and language that I had difficulty following along with. I did eventually get the general grasp of what Thoreau was trying to say, though, which was basically that we don’t need a multitude of complicated additions to our lives to improve them. We just need the necessities. 
            <br><br>

I’ve been thinking over the themes of minimalism that were present in both this week and last week’s lessons, and the more I think about it, the more I believe I’d be happier adhering to that lifestyle. I often leave behind a lot of things in my childhood bedroom when I move into new housing or come back from breaks, and I find that life is generally much simpler and my space is much cleaner without them. However, when I go back home, I get irked with how crowded my space is due to the buildup of random items I’ve accumulated over my life. Though that is not at all an example of living minimally, it’s made me think about the positives of living without things that are unnecessary to my everyday life.

After reading the first chapter of Walden, I believe that living a minimalist or “simple” lifestyle in nature would be good for the generation now, personally before evening reading Walden and before taking this class, that it is something I’ve been playing to do once I finish college, my friend and I want to move out of California and somewhere more low-key I guess is how I put it. If more us practiced what Thoreau preached about in is his book I feel like overall we would be a more happier generation, because we are so consumed with trying to live or maintain this luxury lifestyle, when in reality you don’t need to but since it’s considered the “norm” everyone wants to be like that. We spend all our time idolizing people like the Kardashians and trying so hard to be like them and trying to gain money and fame, but then we end becoming stressed and overwhelmed trying to keep up with that lifestyle. Honestly if living a simpler life was a “trend” then an overwhelming amount of people would try to live that way, but since it’s not no one wants too.

After watching the documentary Minimalism, I’ve come to look at all of the things that I own, from clothes, shoes, the amount of pillows that I have on my bed, to the little trinkets I have stuffed in the back of my desk drawer, and noticed I probably didn’t need to purchase all of them. It really got me thinking about the number of things I buy that I don’t really get much use out of after a while, but at the time I felt the need to buy it. To be fare I don’t spend as much money now as I did in high school, and not nearly as much as I see other people do. some people are what one calls a shopaholic, and they make it seem “as if objects were as important as people” -Gail Stekete. 
            <br><br>

There were many quotes that stuck out to me like the one by Jim Carrey “I wish everyone could become rich and famous so they can realize it’s not the answer” and the one at the very end of the documentary, “Love people and use things, because the opposite never works”. The first one helps the argument that we don’t need a lot of things to be happy because it’s coming from someone who already does and is living proof that it’s not the answer. The second one just kind of has stuck with me since I heard it, because I know people who do the opposite, so you can say it kind of hit home. 
            <br><br>

I like that Ken included this in the material to watch because it’s exposing us to alternative options to help the environment and proves that this live style is possible while still living your best life. I truly believe minimalism is a viable option to help reduce the amount of emission that comes from the factories that produce these goods.

After read Walden, I found Thoreau’s idea is just his mental fantasy. In order to meet his mental fantasy, he still requires the supplies from the city to meet his needs physically. It is true that people should live in small spaces and live desireless. However, Thoreau’s idea about back to nature is just a fantasy because people require things produced by industries so do Thoreau himself. Only could people fulfill their physical needs could they start to chase their mental fantasy. If people live in a lifestyle that even they work hard they still facing the problem of starving, people live in this lifestyle will only have the fantasy of money beyond measure. How do workers in America 100 years ago to pursue their spiritual needs while having a starving family? No way! It is because Thoreau himself have enough money to live in a life without starving could he start to think to pursue his mental desire. It is true that people could live desireless, but first, they must fulfill their physical needs.

I was in the English 22 class, so I have a bit of extra knowledge of the background of Thoreau and Walden, knowing that he wasn’t the true first environmentalist, that those roots go so much further back than most of us really realize. While he might not have been the first, I must give due credit in saying that Henry David Thoreau was in fact one of the first to truly make waves in society. He pulled all his artillery from those before him and used it to make one massively impactful novel in one grand scheme against conformity, consumerism, vegetarianism, poverty, and so much more. 
            <br><br>

Of course, there are things Walden did incorrectly. Last quarter Ken pointed out that Thoreau does in fact fetishize the environment in being something that still behaves in an outlet made for Thoreau. To be fair, he was one of the first environmentalists, so maybe some aspects got away from him. If you’re the first one at something, it’s likely you’re going to overlook some things in hindsight. I also believe it to be a bit questionable that he only made an effort for two years, which is still a fair amount of time, but it’s nonetheless a project he only committed to so for long. There are flaws, but as are many in many plans. Still, overall Walden creates a commentary on consumerism, which factors into behaving more environmentally conscious, unlike anything really done before. It was a book that finally ushered a movement. Obviously, to this day we struggle with consumerism, so it isn’t as though he stopped the issue, however his book is what starting bringing the guilt of misusing the environment to mind, which is something so admirable in a time when people with Thoreau’s consideration were far and few in between.

Though I disagree with this sentiment, Thoreau presents a scathingly fascinating vision of Mankind and its relation to needs and luxury.

I liked the section when the protagonist meets a native-american person selling baskets. It compels the reader to think about the spread of a western invention: the market. Native-american tribes who succumb to colonization are pushed to assimilate through market participation. This is an interesting mechanic since the concept of private property is very foreign to [most, not all] native tribes.

I am really interested in Thoreau's ideas. According to him, we need to seriously consider what is necessary to our life. Food, house and clothes are major necessities. However, the current society teaches to purchase far more than these basic stuffs. Our standards for dropping things have changed completely. In the past, uselessness is the only norm, but now "obsolete" became the new one. As Ken mentioned, Thoreau made a very interesting analogy: when monkeys in Paris wear traveler's hats, every monkey in America also do this. Although it is a funny comparision, the sentence exposes a cruel reality: big industries try to control our mind and behavior. Once we fall into their setting of the world, it will be difficult for us to get out. Thoreau was one of the wise men who saw the trick. He employed his own experience to show that men can live happily without owning too many objects. After I came to America, I spend a lot less than at home. Before, I often went shopping in large market and waste a lot of money to buy useless things. But now the environment is different, I cannot go shopping as often as before. However, my happiness increases instead of decreasing. This is because I start to gain interest in other fields besides shopping.

I agree with your idea that Thoreau used his personal experience to show that people can gain happiness without consumerism. In the first part of Walden, he depicted the process of building a cheap and comfortable "house" and express his ideas that most furniture is useless. He was unhappy about the fashion industry and railways since he advocates a simple and environmentally friendly lifestyle. All his ideas about the relationship between humans and nature were quite advanced at his time. Though Thoreau's action was very extreme, he raised people's consciousness about the environment in the future.

One step forward maybe a dozen steps backward. This is the idea put forth by Thoreau when he 'reverts' his life to a more simple form of living. When we look at our society we see the progression of harmful technologies. We fracked our farmlands, we destroyed our mountains, we burned away our forests, at the end of the millennia, we will be left with a barren lifeless planet if we do not alter our course. Thoreau being the transcendentalist, was able to see that this disregard for nature flew in the face of the inherent divinity with all life. By advocating for a simple lifestyle Thoreau hoped to inspire change, but what he did wasn't enough and we continued our backslide creating a worse and worse situation leading us to the situation we are today.
            <br><br>


We are at the tipping point and if we want to achieve a victory that means something we must resort to 'Civil Disobedience' we can't wait for past generations to yield their power, We must take it in increasingly radical ways. I am not advocating for violence I absolutely deplore the idea. But we must mobilize en masse when it comes time to vote. But despite all this, even amongst our ranks, we have individuals who won't even recognize climate change as an areal threat. As much as it pains me to admit we must prepare for mitigation of the effects climate change will have on our planet and society.

I agree with your statement, what was once something so simple, so at ease, became the after effects of human activity harming our natural environment. I feel the same way about the voting solution, now more than ever is the time for many of our younger generations to get involved and advocate for change. Because if we don't do something about it now, then who will. I understand where you are coming from when you say that we have to prepare for the effects of climate change because of the reason being some individuals not recognizing it as a threat. However, I feel that if we just focus on the impact of climate change, rather informing these individuals of solutions of taking action now, that will at least in some sense help a bit with reducing their carbon footprint.


<br><Hr>
I like what you said about "Civil Disobedience". I completely agree. Even as we may pretend that our individual actions are the sole issue with climate change, the fact of the matter is considerable political power must be wielded if we are to actually change the system that insensitivizes environmental destruction. Thoreau seems to me to be very conflicted here, because he advocates in Walden for simplicity and a removal from the chaos of society, yet is also known to be a proponent of using this refusal to adhere to societal norms to actually shape and change the political landscape. 

            <br><br>

As you also pointed out, I find it interesting that the values Thoreau wrote about: environmental reverence, material simplicity, and freedom from societal norms, are even more important today. These values must come into the mainstream American culture if we are to change things. This ties in to what Ken was saying, about making things like mass transit and voluntary simplicity "cooler" than cars and excessive possessions.

I found this reading particularly interesting because it referred to many solutions that Professor Hiltner suggested in his last video, which makes it sad to see that all this time has passed and so many of us still struggle to do our part in protecting the environment. It’s quite upsetting to know that Thoreau wrote this in response to a 19th century lifestyle, which we cannot even begin to compare to our 21st century lifestyle in terms of our materialistic world. That is one of the reasons why readings like this are more important than ever. When I reflect on the extent of my minimalist lifestyle, I find that my life here at college differs drastically to my life back home, in terms of the clothing items I own, how often I eat meat, and the size of my house. I find myself asking if I “need” something or if I just want it just to own it, which I think has helped reduce my consumption. If it is possible for me to live a more minimalist lifestyle here at school (obviously not as minimalist as Thoreau’s experience), why shouldn’t I make that change back home? I find it interesting that Professor Hiltner says that past generations want us to follow our “path,” like they did, but now is the time to change the mindset that “bigger is better” and that more will lead to higher levels of happiness. This is particularly hard in today’s society because we have allowed for companies to convince us that what we have is never enough, and that there is always something better that we seem to need. I have fallen victim to this so many times, like buying the new iPhone when mine works perfectly fine. We as consumers fall into this trap, and it's occurring on such a large scale that it makes it very difficult to try to regain our power as consumers, but is very necessary that we attempt to do so.

I found Henry David Thoreau's call to a simpler life fascinating. Throughout the chapter he showed us the way the people would sacrifice their entire lives just to fit into society and own a home. But the saddest part was that owning that home or renting that home made them even poorer than before. I feel like Thoreau was marveling about the lengths people would take to fit in and the way they saw that owing bigger houses and new clothes would lead them to a happier life but that's not necessarily true. These people spend years toiling long hard hours for these materialistic things but like Thoreau says have no time for knowledge and questioning their own ignorance. What then is the point of their lives? Living to work for materialistic things and not having time to expand your knowledge and question life does not seem like a very good life to me.

            <br><br>

I did however find some of Thoreau's suggestions a little over the top. I believe his whole reasoning for not trading was a little too much. He claimed that, that would lead to the devil and I guess he might have meant that would lead him to want to spend more. However, I believe that if you want to live a life free from excessive consumption, it is good to have a little bit of everything. The more you deny yourself of things the more you crave them. If you consume things at a moderate amount and are conscious of the effects of things you purchases you should be fine. Moreover, when Thoreau mentioned the dorms built for the university students it made me think about UCSB and the way I am currently living. The price to live here has been really expensive and draining me financially. I entertained the idea of building a place like Thoreau did but came to the realization that it's just not possible at this current time. I do not possess the necessary skills and would not be able to get it approved by the city. So how do we fix the enormous costs of housing in UCSB that are causing a large portion of students to take out loans and financially crippling them? I feel like some students turn to getting an education to get out of  poverty and yet in the process become even poorer than before.

After reading the first chapter of Walden, I found that how I live now in college is kind of similar to how Theoreau was living at Walden Pond for two years in his life. Compared to where I live down in LA, I would say that my lifestyle changed a lot when I started my dorm life. I realized that living with less stuff doesn’t make me feel less secured, but instead freer than how I live before. I don’t need to think twice about what I should wear every morning, I could pick up a shirt and a pair of jeans in less than a minute. The stuff I thought I would need in order to have a normal day doesn’t seem necessary. Because I’ve seen the film “Minimalism” in English 22, there’s one idea I could relate Walden’s first chapter to, having less doesn’t restrict us from owning stuff, it just takes on a different approach of owning stuff you really like and truly need, stuff that has value. It also gives us the power of choosing to spend less rather than make more, which clearly, one easier than the other. And by consuming less of what we don’t actually need, we are helping ourselves as well as the environment.

After watching Ken's video and reading the actual text of Walden, I find myself can not agree more to the fact that Thoreau is the modern and first proponent of a minimalist lifestyle. Thoreau tries very hard to illustrate the benefits of the simplest lifestyle throughout the chapter and this Walden experiment. I agree with him about the problems with excess possessions and night and day laboring. When we try so hard to and work so diligently for more consumption, we are not actually gaining freedom. The freedom for Thoreau is to obtain less and live happily with only the necessities of life which he identifies as food, shelter, clothes, and fuel. Thoreau is also brave to point out flaws of the "rules" or the "scripted lifestyles" set by the old people. He uses the Walden experiment to prove that people can also gain freedom and happiness without the obsessions for goods and services. This is meaningful for all of us and I believe this notion should be held by our citizens if we want to tackle the climate crisis that is getting worse and worse over days. As we change our consumption-driven lifestyles, we can start to solve the climate issues from the root. Thus, a notion of minimalist lifestyle works the best for our first steps.

After reading the first chapter of “Walden” by Henry David Thoreau, I am surprised that there were people believing in a very simple lifestyle back in 19th century. In fact, I do believe that my life is going to be much different and may be happier if I choose to live with a simpler lifestyle. Nowadays, people spend most of their time making money in order to achieve a better living standards, such as luxuries, housing, cars, etc. On the other hand, we spend little time on enjoying our lives and what we have now. In other words, our lives are indeed not that happy compared to the simple lifestyle. “Most of the luxuries, and many of the co-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meager life than the poor,” as Thoreau mentions, I find it it so true that the simple lifestyle provide us not only a more environmental friendly lifestyle for the planet but also a simpler, easier, and happier life.

I found Walden as a bit too radical.  Henry David Thoreau presents very rebellious ideas against the consumer culture as he altogether abandons it to live in a forest by a pond and to be one with nature.  As he does this, he criticizes the accepted urban culture as it contrasts to the bliss simplicity of living in the woods.  However, I did not find Thoreau's idea as very environmentally friendly as he calls for living in the environment instead of living in the cities.  I think a derivative that people may take inspiration from off of this text is to live in the suburbs where housing can take more space and have a larger carbon footprint.  Also, if everyone was to abandon the city to live in the country side, it would be very harmful to the environment.  His suggestion would seem much to extreme to most individuals anyways as most people have too much to lose to be able to run away to the countryside. Therefore I think an important thing to take from Walden is not what Thoreau was thinking, but how he was thinking, and I believe this connects well with what Ken explained by reconsidering our roles in society.  When Thoreau explained the significance of living on the country side, he demonstrated a new way of thinking unbound by societal expectations.  Thoreau found his own new role or purpose that he wanted to foresee in his life, and what we learn from this is that the pursuit of happiness can be different for everyone.  One culture cannot fit the way everyone want to live their life.  Especially since the current consumer culture is disastrous for the environment, it's time to explore options for new roles in life, just as Thoreau did, in hopes of finding a better fit for our personal desires and essentials for life.

Reading through, Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" depicts 19th century minimalism very well. It describes the basic necessities that one needs and explains the luxuries that people indulged themselves too at the time. Professor Hiltner also stresses the point in this video of excess of clothing and fashion that was taking place in the 19th century. Thinking upon this, today has become much worse for the increased need for clothing. I used to be like this in high school, always wanted the new and hip clothing. It wasn't until coming to college and living with one of my housemates last year that made me realize how much waste there is made up by clothing alone. The simple way he pointed this out is by taking thrift shopping. I realized at the store thrift store there was so much excess in clothing that I did not consider out of style; why continue to waste my money and time trying to buy the latest fashion. To get back to the reading, one line that stood out to me was, "I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of." this example describes the simplicity of minimalism to me.

Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden: Economy” was very interesting reading to me. Thoreau argues that living a minimalistic life or simple lives in the forest was how humans should change their style to. This chapter specifically influenced many people to go out into the woods and actually build these small houses that we environmentally sustainable. He wanted people to live life with the most basic necessities, such as water, food, shelter, and clothing. This lifestyle of living in the wilderness isn’t very realistic or ideal for many people, however, the idea of a simplistic lifestyle with little waste is not unrealistic. Many people are far more happy with nice, simple, easy-going lives than those who love complicated fast-paced lifestyles. Being a college student makes me live a simplistic lifestyle and not contribute to a lot of waste. I live with 3 other people in small dorm rooms and we are all so happy. Not because of what we have, but because of what is around us and the connections we have formed. I agree with Thoreau in the sense that wanting bigger things is not a necessity and not even economical for you. You can buy a smaller house and still have the same happiness or be even happier.

Yeah I completely agree with you on that. I live in a 2b2b with three other girls in a university-owned apartment. I feel if people can do this -- living in small apartments with others-- when they are in college, they are able to do so later in their lives instead of buying larger houses. 
<br><br>
I've heard of Walden since my childhood, but this is actually my first time reading it, and yes similar to you, the idea of simplicity interests me. I've always liked to keep things, thinking that I might use them later, but my mother often tells me to get rid of all the unnecessary things, and if I really do that, I indeed feel happier, lighter, and calmer. This might be the magic of "less is more". I also like the idea that Thoreau realizes the importance of inward growth and spiritual rebirth. The houses, clothing...they will never be big enough, they will never be fashionable forever, so we keep moving into bigger places and buying more clothes and luxuries. Truly a society-wide addiction. As Thoreau said: "No man has to be so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked." I believe that finer fruits can benefit us with more meaningful values.

<br><Hr>

I think as college students we can't really say that it's easy to live in a small house and be happy. We are forced into these living conditions and we still are paying maybe twice as much one would pay to live in a bigger house somewhere in Central California. Most of us don't know what it is like being an adult and raising a family in modern times. Why would you force your family to live minimally when we worked our entire lives to get money and achieve more.  In the 19th century it was probably enticing to live in a small cabin in the wilderness, but that is so detached to what kind of world we living now. Just as society changed to a mass culture of consumerism our concept of living minimally has to change as-well.

Unexpectedly, I found Thoreau’s writing to be surprisingly still relevant to our problems today. For example, his writing on why he disagreed with the man who wouldn’t go vegetarian. Thoreau wrote, “One farmer says to me, "You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with"; and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle.” This irony noted by Thoreau is an honest argument for vegetarianism. So many other animals are able to maintain extreme strength and healthy bodies on solely herbivore diets. If they can, humans surely can. We don’t eat meat out of necessity, we eat it out of pleasure. If we truly cared about decreasing methane emission, we would switch to vegetarian/vegan diets.
 <br><br>
Ultimately, Walden is a great display of why the new generation should be free thinkers and revolutionize our materialistic culture. Thoreau wrote, “You may say the wisest thing you can, old man -- you who have lived seventy years, not without honor of a kind -- I hear an irresistible voice which invites me away from all that. One generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels.” About 150 years later, Thoreau’s message of being a progressive generation applies to our own new generation today. The generation above us is indeed like “stranded vessels”. They are unwilling to accept the fact that their way of living is destroying our Earth. It is up to us to abandon their way of living and begin our own environmentally conscious methods.

The switch from being omnivores to strictly vegetarian or vegan would be an essential first step to reversing the effects of climate change, but the hardest part about that would be convincing people to change their diets. I've read a comment on a previous video that science can only do so much. We can use science to research how to solve climate change, but the change that must be made starts with us--the people. As someone who does eat meat, when I first heard about how the meat industry hurts the Earth and that vegetarianism/veganism is a solution, I immediately thought something along the lines of...okay is there anything else I can do because I'm not going to give up meat. As I got more educated about it, I realize there are other alternatives out there and giving up meat does not mean its the end of the world, if anything it helps the world. Eating meat is a norm of society and the idea of cutting out something so normal is a hard act. Speaking of the norms of society, I realized that Thoreau speaks about simplicity and how a simplistic lifestyle is the way to go. Meanwhile, everyone wants to "grind" so that they can make money and be able to afford really expensive and luxurious things (i.e. big houses, brand name clothing, etc.). Reversing the capitalistic mindset everyone in the US has, will be extremely hard. Although science has proved that less cars, no meat, no fast fashion will lead to a healthier Earth, these are all things that people in the US have always known and are used to. Such a drastic and sudden change might turn people off. People want climate change to be fixed, but might not have the willpower to start that change with themselves which makes it hard to believe that we will be able to save our planet.

I found that everything you said really resonated with what I felt after initially reading Walden. I thought Thoreau's comments on the idea of vegetarianism not only to be correct and well-backed, I also liked the dry humor that followed the irony of being out strengthened by a vegetarian beast. Similar to what Matthew was saying about how age doesn't necessarily translate to wisdom, I found the early part of Walden to be based on this idea. Thoreau claims that a man who only knows how to follow the wants and needs of other people has no part in giving wisdom. He also shows that the civilized man thinks too much of himself by explaining that while less than half of civilized folk own the house which they live in, the supposed "savage" man is entirely independent and lives his life how he chooses all from the comforts of his own home. Paired up with the Minimalist documentary, I've really taken the idea of using only what is necessary to heart. For all that we should have is what we need and what we generally want for our personal sake not what new fads or what society tells us to want.

This weeks reading was, in my opinion, extremely relevant to what we have been learning about in class. There are many factors that are contributing to the damage we are doing to our environment but a large factor is the consumer culture that we are so used to today. This reading was a great way to show that there are other ways to live life that don't involve constant consumption of goods. I think as a society we share this belief that having more will make us happier and everyone is always trying to chase happiness by consuming more and more. I think it is easy to say that most people want to be safe and to enjoy their lives. We have developed this mentality that the only way to do this is to have a lot of stuff because the more things you have the happier you will be. In reality there is no evidence that having more stuff makes life any better. Sure it is cool to have the newest iPhone and to have huge televisions and a nice car, but at the end of the day these items are all overkill and they have the same basic functions as much simpler items. It is unfortunate that society admires those who have more, because not does this support unsustainable habits but it leads to a society that mainly cares about material value. 
<br><br>
Throughout history mankind has fought for freedom and the culture we have created is in a way taking our freedom away. Thoreau explains whether we realize it or not, living these complex consumer lifestyles makes us prisoners in our daily lives. Having or wanting excess possessions leads to the need for more and more unnecessary labor. Many of us have become prisoners to labor,  living unhappy lives working more and more to achieve possessions that we don't need. We have become so concerned with material items that we ignore the finer things in life. Things like caring for each other, the beauty of the environment around us and the health of the planet. Not only does this consumer lifestyle give us a false sense of happiness but it is destroying our planet and we have become so invested In this process that many don't even care about the damage that is being done. I think Ken made the most important point in his video: we must re-write the script and change our roles in society.

In Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden”, the text encourages readers to live a life of simplicity and modesty as minimalism. Thoreau challenged the excessive lifestyle and argued that the only necessities we need are food, fuel, clothing, and shelter just like he did in that small cabin in the woods. He believes that the desire of wanting more and the pressure of making the most money will greatly impede our pursuit of happiness and satisfaction. The lifestyle that Thoreau lived in his couple of years at Walden Pond not only brought himself a peace of mind but also was beneficial for the environment. If more people on earth could be influenced by this kind of lifestyle and start to live more like Thoreau, the task of mitigating climate change will be taken another big step. Human could truly achieve the satisfaction of living and re-feel and appreciate the beauty of nature. Production will decrease and so do our carbon footprint. The balance between man and nature will gradually return. Thinking about this, in order to save our planet and for future generations to live a better life, we must change our understanding and pursuit of material life and actually take some actions.

I agree, Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” really emphasizes the simplicity of life’s necessities. I also think there is such a desire in American culture, that money does buy happiness and that money determines one’s success. But does it really define the quality of life? Our lives are shaped by the consumeristic culture our society has constructed. As a result, society determines and defines our life by the amount of money and things we own. Because of this, the consumeristic mindset of American culture takes away the true meaning of life. The constant need to consume more things, leaves us disconnected from nature and reality. Additionally, there is great societal pressure to have material things, creating an inevitable need to have more. However, the more we have, the less we appreciate, and the more we lose sight of the things that are important. This consumeristic world disconnects society from reality. We selfishly buy things to make us "happy" despite knowing the true cost of it (i.e. sweatshops, child labor, environmental degradation, pollution, etc). Disconnected from reality, we continue to consume more and more, even though these material “needs” come at a terrible cost to humans and to our environment.

I found this chapter particularly interesting, because I think a lot about minimalism's possible applications in our world. I find it frustrating that we literally don't have the choice, in this day and age, to choose Thoreau's way of life. If I wanted to use scrap wood to create my own home, live off the food in my garden, and buy or make dependable clothes once every few years, I would still need to work for a surplus of money because the government taxes everyone ruthlessly. I suppose I could fake my own death if I wanted to live off the land, but that seems a little extreme.
<br><br>
This chapter was also quite hard for me to read because, since it was written in 1854, it contains a lot of ethnocentric undertones. He seems to be very proud of his way of living off the land. The truth of minimalism is the best it was ever practiced was by indigenous peoples before European cultures took over and industrialized. Trying to practice environmentalism without acknowledging and trying to learn from the practices of indigenous people is foolish and needlessly difficult. The idea that this way of living is not just difficult, but today impossible, is heartbreaking. We have truly been completely separated from our land.

This novel, well at least the first chapter, shared a different view of life to the reader. Thoreau explains how we live in a world with too many wants. He tries to challenge himself and change his lifestyle to a minimalistic one for two years. He decides to live in the woods and he builds a cabin with borrowed tools. He furnished his home with only the basic necessities and enjoyed life in a simple way. His way of living sounds like a fun activity; however, I believe most people wouldn’t last very long. I mean, Thoreau didn’t make that a permanent lifestyle. He stopped living in the woods after two years. Still, more than any of us. If we tried to live the way he did for those two years we wouldn’t get the same results. For one, there would be way more people trying to live in the woods which would interfere with wildlife that is already living there. It is interesting to see how Thoreau noticed the importance of living a simple life long before the problem of over consumption that we have today. I think if Thoreau could see how we live our daily lives he wouldn’t be surprised. He realizes it’s something that needs to be changed in our lives, but it is extremely difficult to get everyone onboard with the idea of living a minimalist life.

"Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but follows religiously the new." This quote, in my opinion, is very indicative of how the hive mind dictates our preferences and how we act. This isn't just true for fashion but life itself. So many of us are so preoccupied with the newest phone or clothing line which makes us lose sight of the things that'll actually make us happy. This isn't to say that these things CAN'T or WON'T make you happy. That is purely up for you, yourself, to decide, not others. Another important aspect of this quote is how we  are so critical of older generations, yet we fall into the same issues that we are so critical of. I find it ironic how so many people like to blame the "boomers" for ruining our planet, yet so many of us aren't willing to sacrifice some of our own well-being for the greater good. Yeah, we can cry all we want about the carbon emission rates have been rising for so many years but that does nothing unless we put in the effort to actually change anything. I know it isn't as easy as just giving away all your possessions and living in the wilderness (coming from someone typing this on their own laptop with an airpod in his left ear) but simply taking out one serving of meat from your day every week can do so much for the environment. 
<br><br>
I think Thoreau's journey of almost completely cutting himself off from society is particularly admirable. Personally, I would find this to be extremely difficult, especially in a modern society where there's so much emphasis on technology and communication. However, once again, it isn't always necessary to go the extreme that he did. We just need to take tiny steps of reducing our life need, and eventually I do believe we will live happier lives.

Although I don't desire the lifestyle that Thoreau describes in his book, I can appreciate how he pursued that lifestyle because it was what he wanted. Many people are so terrified of making changes in any aspect of their lives because they have become comfortable with the way they presently lived. However, the author was willing to change his lifestyle because it made him happy. I won't try to lie and say that I have any intention of living a life without a minimum amount of material goods; such a life wouldn't make me happy. But some people are totally ok with that sort of life and I absolutely admire someone who is willing to go against social norms to pursue something that will ultimately bring them bliss.

In the beginning of reading this, I was very confused, I hadn't taken AP lit so I was having a tough time following, not understanding how Thoreau's point's connected to the climate crisis. However I soon saw that Thoreau was exemplifying a way of life that our generation must head towards if we want to save our planet. Thoreaus showed us how simply one could live without all the extra's and materials that have gotten us into the climate crisis. I appreciated how he showed exactly how much money he spent on housing, food, etc. because you were able to see how cheap it truly is to live without all the luxuries many of us have and crave. Ultimately the climate crisis is driven by greed, of those in oil companies, fast fashion, the meat industry and many others, who are all focused on making the most profit so they can have the nicest things. Our generation, as was mentioned was already born into houses twice as big as our parents and their parents, and this lavish yet consequential lifestyle has become our standard. However this needs to change as we too are still a part of nature who are meant to live equal to one another and the other animals and species on earth. However we are not only destroying our own lives with this greed, but that of the harmless beings who haven't contributed to the crisis.
<br><br>
He also shows the importance of individualism, and taking accountability for yourself rather than just waiting for everyone else too. In fact he claims "“the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another man must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off.” He took his own initiative to go out and experience the world in the most natural self-less way possible. This relates to what the movement to help the climate crisis is all about because if we are always waiting for a treaty to be made, or for a whole country state, or even community to be on board, we will always be waiting. Change starts with the individual, and individuals in large numbers are eventually what lead to change. This piece of writing showed how it is our responsibility to not blame the crisis on previous generations or push it to the future ones to be fixed, but rather take it upon ourselves to start the change one by one until the whole world is involved.

After reading chapter 1 of Henry David Thoreau's "Walden," I was surprised to find out that movements towards minimalism had originated that early in our course of history. It's almost as if Thoreau foreshadows that he knows some sort of climate crisis will happen in the future and that people are going to need to appreciate the environment more. Thoreau really breaks down the things that humans need for survival (and nothing extra)- food, water, shelter, and a healthy mind. What he is really saying is that we do not need luxuries for happiness because with luxury comes at a cost to things like the environment. Although a lot of Thoreau's ideas advocate for a shift towards simplicity and minimalism, to mimic his choice of living in todays society would be somewhat impossible and/or undesirable for many. However, I think it is important people are exposed to at least the idea of reducing consumption and materialism because it will make us think twice before purchasing something we don't need.

When reading Walden I thought it was really interesting the way that he lived, being very minimalist. I thought that the reading for this week really connected to the movie. After, watching the movie I thought that the minimalist lifestyle was interesting, however I still did not have a very clear idea of how this worked. I thought that the reading really supplemented the movie because I read this week I really got a clearer idea on how the lifestyle works and got to real learn about the specifics of this type of living. I do think that the reading was not particularly easy to follow as the author was really kind of all over the place. However, I do think that he had good ideas. I do agree with the author that societies today is far way too dependent on material things in order to be happy. I think that the happiness of someone should not depend on how many luxurious things they own. The reading really shows that it is possible to be happy living a very minimalistic lifestyle.

In this week's reading Walden discusses the topic of the ignorance of man. The ignorance of man to the fact that they do not hold all of the knowledge of the universe. At one point he says "You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with"; and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle.” even as men expect a herbivorous ox to do the jobs that they can't they insist that eating meat makes for better bones. 
<br><br>

He also talks about how extremely selfish we are with the resources of the earth. We strip animals of their lives and shelters in order to improve our own comfort and quality of life. We, as humans, never stop wanting. I find it very interesting that this piece was written so long ago and even the there was individuals aware of the issues and mistakes humans as a race were making. It is very thought provoking in that even a hundred years ago we turned a blind eye to our flaws and we continue to do so in today’s climate crisis. It is an eerie feeling.

In chapter 1 “Economy” of Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden”, he explored ideas that would be the catalyst of modern minimalism as well as contemporary ways of living that allow us to fulfill needs that are beyond the material level. Although unconventional and in contrary to the norms of the materialistic society we live in, his proposed ways of living focusing on sustainability and self-criticism deeply struck me and made me question my lifestyle. A part of me also wonders if I could truly escape the shackles of modern consumerism and ignore the expectation of my parents as well as the material definition of success they’ve taught me since I was a kid. Since pop-culture has made notions like owning multiple properties, following fashion trends, and other materialistic lifestyles such integral parts of modern society, I believe most of the general public will find it very hard to adapt to his way of living. I also find his beliefs to be very similar to the Buddhists’ perspective on the relationship between suffering and desire. Thoreau believes one can find inner peace in many activities once the pursuit of wealth is not the priority anymore whereas Buddhism believes suffering arises from attachment to material desires. It is interesting to see how his philosophy beliefs are similar to religious preachings on a fundamental level.

I find your comment to be very interesting and similar to my thoughts on chapter 1 of Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden”.  Like you said,  his focus on sustainable living and minimalism in compared to the materialistic life he left was a huge focus of his.  I was surprised, however, at the idea that departing from modern consumerism is not mutually exclusive as withdrawing from the sense of selfishness that drives our everyday society.  Like he said, “the man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long time before they get off”. As Thoreau states later on, he has been criticized for this point of view, but I understand his point.  Not everything comes easy, but it is much harder when you do not put yourself first.  That could also pertain to the idea of being environmentally conscious, as it is in not only the planet’s favor, but also for each and every one of us.  As we live a life that is clean and simple, we are not only mentally healthy, but also support the physical health of the people, animals, and plants around us.  We live in a balanced ecosystem, one that should not be affected by a lust for wealth.  Like Thoreau said and you echoed, our material attachments are unnecessary.


<br><hr>
I agree with you. I’m not sure if I could give up a consumer lifestyle. When you mentioned “ignore the expectation of mt parents as well as the material definition of success” I knew I wanted to respond to your comment. In Ken’s lecture, he says that on average your house if 2 and ½ times larger than your parents. It’s many people’s mission to give back to their parents. When one is deemed successful, they immediately want to upgrade. Upgrading usually means bigger and Thoreau challenges us to be minimalistic. The phrase “bigger is better” goes against Thoreau’s mentality. I thought your perspective on the similarities between Buddhism and Thoreau’s principles. I really don’t see the future decreasing their closet space, including properties, spaces, and materials.

<br><hr>
Hi. After reading "Walden", it made me question  the race of consumerism we live in today. Thoreau explains how much simple life would be if we abandon all the irrelevant necessities. The economy and its people today and in our civilized society need to stretch its focus from an individual perspective and consider its impact to their surroundings. I agree that people won't stop having a consumerist mindset instantly or struggle to do so. But society shifts gradually and all it takes is some people to shift the economic crisis from the obsession with consumer goods into liberation.  I also find it interesting how you compared Thoreau's beliefs to Buddhism because they have important insights spiritually and philosophically that are very similar.

After reading the first chapter “Walden” written by Henry David Thoreau, I found that I am starting to accept this kind of lifestyle. In his article, he introduce his simplified lifestyle to us. Since last week when I first encountered this lifestyle, for a moment I cannot accept it because it is way different from what the lifestyle I am living with. However, after reading Thoreau’s article, I start to realize the significance of a simplified lifestyle while we are currently trapped in a materialized lifestyle. We purchase excessive stuff to “enrich” our life, and these stuff are totally unnecessary. We can just purchase what we need, and reduce the waste when they are broken or inappropriate. In addition in our daily necessities, we can reduce climate crisis by eating less meat, or no meat at all. Since all vegetarian on Earth are just as healthy as others, or even more. The only difference between vegetarian and those who eat meat is just the food. We are capable of acquiring the nutrients on meat from vegetables. By doing it, we save a lot of carbon dioxide and methane that is suppose to be emitted to atmosphere.

After I read the first chapter of "Walden," It is surprising to learn how Henry David Thoreau changed his lifestyle two hundred years ago. With a simplified lifestyle, Thoreau closely connects himself with nature. As a Transcendentalist, the connection between human and nature are specifically emphasized in Walden.  Thoreau also introduces the ideas of minimalism, which is quite beneficial to our society that leads to a sustainable environment. In contrast, in the video, Ken said that most Americans in his generation should be able to "live how they want, eat how they want, and buy what they want." They deserved to live a desirable life because this is what they earn through their hard work. Such actions have made our environment deteriorate for several decades because people have wasted lots of resources and polluted our environment. We should change our lifestyle as Thoreau did in the past, and it would be quite beneficial to solve the climate issue.

I've heard multiple articles, and people, call Thoreau a hypocrite. This because he came from a wealthy family who owned a pencil company, and had frequent meals at his mother's house, thus one could argue that he wasn’t being true to his experiment since he was finding some ways to escape his minimalist reality. However, I believe that Thoreau did an amazing job as a minimalist and successfully established a lifestyle that serves as a reference to minimalists to this day. Thoreau’s figure is very relatable even though he lived in a completely different world from today.

“Walden” back in high school reminded me of a Ted Talk I once saw where a NYU talked about her transition into a zero-waste lifestyle. Although she didn’t try to escape the general human population like Thoreau, she had to limit what she owned. She became mostly self-reliant for everyday products such as toothpaste or shampoo, and if she had to get anything, she thrifted. Just like Thoreau, she discovered that reducing consumption made her happier. Although Thoreau didn’t have the goal of climate protection in mind, he nevertheless found his own personal benefits from minimalism. It’s interesting to see how cutting consumerism has a plus-plus benefit for both a person’s mental well-being and the environment.
 <br><br>

Going back to your point about college students, I think it’s interesting that many of the minimalist lifestyles seem unattainable on paper, but it’s more doable than we think. Just think about how some of us who are used to having our own space in high school are now living in a shared space with a limited budget. If any of us had doubts if we could ever adapt to a different lifestyle, just being here proves that we really could. Similarly, adapting to a long term minimalistic lifestyle may sound intimidating, but it’s all too doable if we actually take action.

One of Henry David Thoreau's stories in "Walden" that stood out to me was the one of the Indian selling baskets to a well-known lawyer. This story really emphasizes the importance and key role of self-discipline in regards to decision-making in life. Thoreau states that instead of trying to make it worth while for others to buy his baskets, he chooses to instead focus on avoiding the necessity of selling them. He says "Why should we exaggerate any one kind [of success] at the expense of the others?" The definition of a "successful" life is thus questioned by Thoreau. Who gets to decide that strictly selling to others is successful? You can lead a successful lifestyle even without selling these worth while baskets, because we shouldn't have one kind of success story (generating wealth in this case) while forcing others to believe that if they aren't making profit that they are failures. In living with this mindset, I believe that we can all work together to combat climate change. First and foremost, we must be open-minded about our definition of a successful lifestyle. Only after we change our current materialistic and lavish definition of a successful life can we start effectively making positive changes to fight the climate crisis.

Having been experienced with reading Thoreau from back in high school and being more confused than anything, I was extremely surprised to have finished the first chapter of Walden feeling enlightened and exposed to a new perspective of truly living a simplistic life. I find it incredibly respectable to Thoreau and others like him who have embarked on committing themselves to sustaining a healthy, and nourishing lifestyle with the absolute bare minimum. He reflected that you do not need what we think we need to experience the true meanings and benefits of life. Providing his own experiences further proves his point, and showing that if he could do it, anyone could. I particularly enjoyed it when he stated, “In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain one's self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we will live simply and wisely.... It is not necessary that a man should earn his living by the sweat of his brow, unless he sweats easier than I do.” In my opinion, this quote embodies his message in that living a minimalist lifestyle is not so to make your life seem unrealistic, or more miserable and harder, but to do the exact opposite. It is to free you of the unnecessary, time consuming, and frivolous aspects of your life in order to expose you and allow you to experience a just as fulfilling, and quite possibly, and even happier and more content life. It is hard to believe that even in his time, people were already being warped into mass consumerism and falling victim to the same things we are now. It really shows that humans are flawed in ways that carry for generations and generations, and when educated on our flaws, a lot of the time we just do not listen. I believe that we should take Thoreau’s message, and the ones being spread now on minimalism, and try our best to implement them into our lives. I think it is somewhat unrealistic to simplify in the way that Thoreau did, nor do I think it is necessary. However, I think ways that Ken has mentioned in past lectures would prove beneficial, and continuously being more conscious of everyday decisions would point toward progress for our own happiness and well being, and ultimately the environment.

Life is lived to find happiness. 
 <br><br>
There are many thoughts that crossed my mind upon reading Walden especially that of what happiness means to me. I feel like the past few generations defines wealth as the ultimatum for life as new updated technology is purchased almost as an essential to communication and social pressures. Although it may sound hypocritical since I too am part of this generation and occasionally purchase technology myself, I feel like people have become too obsessed with technology as a form of social status instead of a tool which through a psychological perspective brings a form of temporary happiness to belong. I agree with Warren’s quote supported by Thoreau that we should “simplify simplified” because we get so emotionally attached to objects. For instance, when your phone drops to the floor you almost immediately will feel stress, anger, and concern perhaps even cry if the screen cracks. Objects should not have the power to control our emotions rather we should have the power to utilize it.
 <br><br>
Henry David Thoreau’s Walden focuses on his experiences stripping away materialism to advocate living the minimalist lifestyle. Throughout this reading, he talks about the costs of living and a scripted life. Everyone is born with certain privileges in comparison to others as we are not all born equally into families with identical, uniform connections to resources. I thought this idea of inequality was very interesting considering that materialistic wealth is not always a causation for happiness. Thoreau in Walden says that he decided to go for this change due to the desire to find the deeper meaning of life other than being attached to materialism and technology which many people in his society transitions in becoming. 
 <br><br>
This reminds me a lot of a recent movie that I watched called Parasite which has a lot of metaphors in it about the society we live in and about materialistic wealth such as having a nice house or fancy clothes. I won’t give spoilers but towards the end, the movie really puts an emphasis on the fact that that happiness is being alive surrounded by those you love, and no amount of money is worth that.

What really struck me when reading Thoreau was when he stated, “He has no time to be anything but a machine,” and that so many of us are stuck in the capitalist lifestyle. Thoreau describes that many people feel there is only one route to take in life and that many of us are stuck in the system of capitalism and cyclical labor. He states, “it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left.” Thoreau is saying that there is a choice. He emphasizes that not everyone needs to make the drastic changes that he did, but that small changes can make a difference as well. In other words, we must “rewrite the script” as said by Ken.  
 <br><br>

Thoreau states, “Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.” When saying this, the idea of necessity as well as the toxicity of materialism is alluded to. I found it fascinating that Thoreau wrote this almost 200 years ago, yet all of his ideas can be directly applied to the present. Not only could he be seen as an advocate of minimalism, but he also alludes to vegetarianism/veganism as well as bashing on fast-fashion. I feel that Thoreau can be an inspiration to all of us and encourage us to take steps towards a simpler life each day. Not only will this simplicity help our earth, but it will help our mental health. Living a life of only necessity will allow us more time to focus on what is meaningful. We get caught up in the cycle of money and material objects which can spiral us into unnecessary stress and anxiety.

When I read this article, the quote “…it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left” was one that I immediately picked out as well. I agree that Thoreau is trying to explain that we do have a choice and that there are other modes of living that we have not even considered due to the fact we were exposed to nothing else. He later, more specifically regarding housing, goes on to say, “Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have.” He is implying that we base what our ideal lifestyle should be off of what we see around us without ever really thinking about what our other options are, even when these options could save us money (such as the case with having a smaller, more functional house). 


 <br><br>

I think this piece is especially important because Thoreau is writing about actually having lived what he is preaching and can is speaking from first-hand experience when he talks about the benefits of simplifying our lifestyles. While he goes to extreme measures, living in a house the size of a shed and building his own furniture, his main message is something that is much more realistically applicable to our lives: he is telling us to consider breaking out of what society has deemed the “normal lifestyle” and look at the option of living a simpler life and the benefits that come with it.

I think that Thoreau's "Walden" is so applicable to the state we are in environmentally and mentally, especially in America today with our consumeristic society. I think that Thoreau made many important points throughout Chapter 1 and encouraged lifestyle changes that would have profound impacts today. The first point I think was very important was his emphasis on simplifying. Thoreau implies that by chasing materialistic goods, man can never truly be satisfied because once you think you have obtained what you wanted, society is already promoting newer, "better" goods, ones that you now desire rather than what you just got. Thoreau states that "he has not time to be anything but a machine", suggesting that by focusing on obtaining materialistic goods man is only focused on economic gain and social status through working tirelessly for things they might not even desire but are pressured by society to have. By simplifying ones life to the necessities you can focus on what is truly important rather than striving for wealth and social status. Thoreau also points our how man has allowed the generations that came before them to influence what they consider to be important in life. He claims that rather than embarking on a journey to find what makes individuals happy, they take what their parents and grandparents viewed as a happy life and try to replicate it or make it even more lavish. I think that this part is especially applicable to today's society. As Ken has stated, today we live in houses multiple times the size of our parents and grandparents and focus on materialistic goods because of the consumeristic society we have grown up in. I think that if we are going to make major environmental impacts to help deter climate change, we will need to rewire how our society functions. I think that by transitioning to a more simplistic and minimalist lifestyle, we can make significant changes that would benefit the environment and the mental health of our society.

Henry David Thoreau's product Walden is very famous and also hard to read. In all, it did have a great influence on people's perspectives on environment. I also feel it will do a great deal of help to the environment if we choose to live the life as Thoreau did when he lived in his Rose cabinet Walden. However, the fact is we can not. Actually, he himself also just lived there for about two years. I also think that there are problems: For example, Thoreau's family was very rich, and he could affordable the things he wanted, and he also did not. have anything to worry about. People's vanity is like this:  if you are not rich enough, you will be willing to spend more on outfits to show their status or wealth. However, if people are rich enough, they tended to care more about fame, or like what Thoreau did, about environment. Although that's just one of my analysis, it did make sense to me. Secondly, even though Thoreau moved to his cabin, his living standard was also much higher than the people who were really poor. If he could not take it for more than two years, what about those people? Sometimes may be the only thing they could do was to try to live, who would think more and. care about the environment?

Reading “Walden” by Henry David Thoreau was interesting, but quite confusing at times. I wasn’t sure why we would have to be reading this book because I didn’t think that it had much to do about what we were learning in class. Reading the book made me realize that some of the concepts that Thoreau explained in chapter one did in fact relate to our class. This whole idea of having too many things and constantly wanting the best and most luxurious things in life demonstrated how people have had a problem with consumerism for a long time. The way that he just spent two years in the woods and lived a life in which he was living pretty minimalistic is astounding, especially for his time.
  <br><br>
He discussed not needing such big houses and farms, most of which the people that lived or owned such properties were in an incredible amount of debt. That these things did not mean much if you were constantly working towards them, but still dying with debt and burdening your children with that. When he stated his expenses and how much he spent building his home, buying/growing food, and buying any other necessities, I was extremely surprised. Although when I first heard about Thoreau (probably sometime in high school, I thought he was a little insane for just going out to live in the woods like that. I would constantly wonder why anyone would ever want to do that. Now, I understand it more and how, by doing this, we cut down on our carbon emission and spend more time on things that we actually enjoy. I think that this chapter opens up my mind more to why people would do this; giving up materialistic items in life in order to be able to live a life that you actually like. Although the reading this week did not necessarily speak about the climate crisis, it made us question how we live and how consumerism takes up so much of our lives. We can live fine without so many things, which in turn will be better for the environment.

What shocked me the most while reading the first chapter of Walden was how relevant it is in present-day. At the time Walden was published in the mid-19th century, new technologies (and obsessions) were being born such as the railroad, telegraphs, and sewing machines. It's inspiring how Thoreau was able to shut out a desire and curiosity to try the latest technologies to live a solitary life at Walden pond. I can't picture anyone I know, myself included, permanently giving up their cars, smartphones, laptops, and other 21st century technologies to live off the grid and become more connected to the natural world.
  <br><br>
Ultimately, the strongest message I took away from Thoreau is that living in simplicity does not have to carry the longstanding stereotypes of living in poverty. A simple lifestyle without excess "stuff," overwhelming materialism, or the need to "keep up with the Joneses" can be highly intrinsically rewarding and provide time to explore one's passions that would otherwise be spent working. In my own job, I tend to get caught up in the idea that working more hours means that I'm able to make more money and in turn buy more stuff or have more fun. This excerpt from Walden provided me with the much-needed reminder that excessively working and worrying about money is degrading physically, mentally, and spiritually and can become more of a detriment than any monetary cost is worth.

Ken said that Thoreau could be considered as the very grandparent of modern minimalism movement, keeping things simpler from the start as much as possible in many aspects such as housing, clothing, and eating. He also appreciated Thoreau as a man who questioned our given scripts from our birth and provided a profound new thought for new generations. Thoreau is worthy of our appreciation and respect and I do think we should live our lives following his patterns such as choose a house whose size is just enough for our daily need, otherwise our consumption from environment would be irreversible and then leave us helpless on the Earth. And from Thoreau's another big challenge-- trying to change our scripts of last several generations--which means that we should judge ourselves and stop endlessly consume resources from the Earth, one thing that Ken had mentioned is a suitable example "beware of all enterprises that require new clothes".

After reading the "Walden", I immediately compared Thoreau's sense and pushing of minimalism to today's intense consumerism. In his novel, he built his own dwelling, owned very few clothes, grew his own food and used it as a source of income, avoided eating meat; essentially, he lived comfortably and did the bare minimum in his time to sustain himself. On the outside, many would scoff at this viewpoint as he could not enjoy the luxuries of life, such as coffee, a bigger house, keeping up with the fashion, drinking, and parties. But who is to say these materialistic things bring any value of happiness and bring a sense of wholesomeness? Walden even challenges this thought directly, proving as much as life would not be as comfortable, life could still sustain itself and one could pursue other pursuits instead of feeding materialistic addictions, such as music, intellectual discovery, self-discovery, and connecting with others. In today's society, I believe we are only increasing the rate of consumerism and still going in the opposite way of Thoreau. Look at our phone plans for example. Many companies, including Apple, urge us to upgrade our phone every year, even though the phone we have is perfectly function and there is no logical reason to upgrade. There is little improvements here and there, but where is the real need to upgrade? It is all a fear of missing out and feeling of peer pressure because everyone else has the phone. This is how consumerism wins. Also, the fast fashion industries, with companies like Forever 21 and H&M, sell clothing at cheap prices and sell what is currently popular. Many of these clothes end up being discarded within months, even not being worn at times. This only adds to the insane amount of waste we have in landfills; that is not even including the pollution that arises from the non-environmentally friendly production processes. As Ken says in this video, our generation cannot live like the one before us and afford to live lives of excess. Our generation is making some improvements, such as more mass transit, higher rates of veganism, a greater focus on thrifting, greater recycling efforts, no plastic bags in our stores, but as a whole, the fire of consumerism is burning bright and has no sign of stopping. I don't think it will be possible to stop it, and there is little hope to think that many in today's society would like to live like Thoreu in "Walden".

While reading Walden, the question that comes up to my mind is: What is the real necessity for a person to live? Nowadays, people often complain that houses are so expensive and couldn’t even afford to buy a place to live, however, Thoreau built a cabin with only $28. Some people could not feed themselves, but, Thoreau spent a few hours a week planting crops to feed his family. In fact, our real necessities are so few, and they are easy to be obtained with simple labors. The necessities of a man's life have not changed because of the progress of human beings. As long as the food fills the stomach, the house only needs to be inhabited. However, in real life, some people already have a house with many bedrooms and two living rooms, he still works hard in order to live more comfortably, or to change a villa. But when he devotes all the efforts into works and earns a lot of money, it is for sure that he forgets most of the beautiful things around, this is not penny wise and pound foolish. Some people are the slave of money, keep it every day, work for it, money is actually his burden. These kind of people are in the majority of the society, they can not satisfy their own desire, and have wants. They had been driven by desire all their lives. I am not saying that it is wrong, but it is the opposite lifestyle with the one in Walden. Walden is also a extreme lifestyle:  put aside all these fames and wealth, take off the gorgeous clothes, do a most true oneself, carefree, enjoy life. To be honest, this kind isn’t suitable for nowadays’ society. So, I believe it is good to be in the middle, you don’t have to be a minimalist, but also don’t driven by the huge desire to consume or lavish.

I too, was struck by the way that Thoreau focused in on what is truly necessary for humans: food, shelter, fuel, and clothing.  This makes me think about just how much unnecessary items I, alone, have.  I particularly found it interesting how he brings up the comparison of humans to other animals, who truly live out of necessity and aren't and cannot be swayed by consumerism.  In my AP env. science class, I learned to view humans as merely another species, but this is a new way that I haven't looked at the human race yet. He goes on to emphasize that humans have always been this way, desiring more than they have in the moment, but bringing into the picture the story of Adam and Eve.  

  <br><br>

I also agree with you that we as a society have become slaves to money and to the corporate world.  There is a constant feeling that we must do more with our lives, and as we do, that we must have something physical to show for it.  This, I believe is where people get so wrapped up in the concept of consumption.  I think you make a good point in your response here, that Walden and our current living situation are two extremes on the spectrum.  There is definitely a balance which is important to find.  Not everyone needs to do what Thoreau has done and go live in a cabin for $28. If everyone begins to make small changes in their lives, we will definitely begin to see a difference in the overall world.

When reading the article, I just feel part of the meaning it wants to express. For example, it is not advisable to blindly pursue the excessive waste of fashion and the pursuit of new things sometimes, but it does not cause deep thinking. After watching the video, I have more thoughts. Thoreau mentioned that his neighbor's house and garden were too large and extravagant. He thought that as long as there was enough bed roll for sleeping. People are always in pursuit of new fashion. It is clear that the old ones can still be used, but they are not enough to keep up with the new trend. People will choose to throw away and change into new clothes. I don't think it's wrong. Basically everyone will spontaneously pursue the new trend and the latest fashion of clothing, but they don't realize that this will lead to extravagance and waste of resources. However, after reading the article again, Thoreau did wake up a lot of people.
  <br><br>

Thoreau also mentioned the import and export of food. I think it makes sense, but I also think it's a good way for the overall economy. It's beneficial for resource utilization to transport all local food products that can't be produced and sold by themselves to other places, not so-called waste behavior.

In the first chapter of  Thoreau’s “Walden,” he removes himself from society and chooses to live a life based off of the principle of simplicity. Throughout this chapter Thoreau preaches the benefits of a minimalist lifestyle. Having less material “riches” will lead to more internal “riches.” It becomes clear that he believes the pressure of making the most money and possessing meaningless commodities will force us to sacrifice the real takeaways from life. The lifestyle that Thoreau lives in his couple of years at Walden Pond is arguably more beneficial for both the individual and the environment. The less pressure we as a society feel to obtain these meaningless luxuries, the more it will benefit the environment as production will decrease and our carbon footprint will decrease as well. Not only will our physical environment benefit from Thoreau’s ideals but our mental environment will as well. In Ken’s response video, he states that in order to even have a slight chance in saving our planet that we must rid of the ideal that you need to live a lavish lifestyle in order to be happy.  In order for future generations to live a happier life we must change the idea that more possessions is equal to more happiness.

I can not agree more with your response, Natalie. My favorite key takeaway from Thoureau's "Walden" is what you mentioned; having less riches in material items will lead to more internal riches.  We have seen countless celebrities fulfill the saying "money doesn't buy you happiness" and it is evident that Thoureau stands by this wholeheartedly. The less we fulfill to conform to, the less conformity and pressure society feels to accommodate a consumerist lifestyle. 
  <br><br>
Ken's claim that in order to even have a minuscule chance at saving our planet, we must abandon this consistent thought of buying more and living materialistically. If it is the only chance we have, dramatic measures need to be set in place. Even social media influencers like Kylie Jenner and others with massive followings need to take action as well, since previously they have contributed immensely to the consumerist ideals.

Walden was an assigned reading back to my high school, however, when I read this again, it did give me a closer insight for what the author was trying to convey. Walden is a book which author wished to explain the spiritually rich life he enjoyed near the pond and more important, he has the opportunity to view society from the outside and in contrast to his "happy situation". 
  <br><br>

In the first chapter, he illustrated his core idea toward "minimalism lifestyle". While other people spent all their time pursuing luxuries and properties, he moved to Walden and reduced all his basic needs to the minimum. From my perspective, he was trying to convey the ideology of "less consuming, more saving" to readers. All those luxury items or extra consumes are unnecessary. Besides, he also mentioned that consumerism could affect the improvement of our society. I strongly agree with this point of view, when we purchase something at a store, ask yourself first that if you necessarily need this item. Getting rid of needless purchasing and saving up is a significant way to help make our planet a better place.

Thinking about people now adays losing their materialistic tendencies. The fact of the matter is that people like to show off, they like to have big houses, nice cars, a couple kids, and so much more. This is engrained into US citizens- Why? Because it is the American dream. I am the 2nd of my generation in America and through the eyes of my elders America is where you come when you want to fully live. I partially live that this is a result of societal pressures, designer clothes are the minimum now and people cling to anything that has monetary significance. Maybe we can change our consumerism but that maybe has been engrained in generations of Americans and the fact of the matter is that definitive change is very unlikely. 
  <br><br>

I’m going to be honest, I think I would very much struggle to live like Thoreau. Not just because of the American mindset but because the life of consumerism is all I know and drastic change brings on so much change. I also feel that people consider the most prominent way to save our planet is to stop all bad greenhouse gas emissions. However, people always neglect that fast fashion does not help, wasting our natural food resources does not help and so many other things that drive our consumer lives.

In Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” the text challenges excessive lifestyles and urges readers to live a life of simplicity and modesty. Throughout the chapter, the author advocates that individuals should subsist on the bare essentials, just as he did in his small cabin in the woods. He suggests that by living off pure necessities, such as clothing, fuel, shelter, and food, we could achieve the satisfaction of living true to ourselves and returning to the beauty of nature. Similarly, this lifestyle would provide us a way out of materialism that has plagued our society. Coincidentally, Thoreau’s suggested way of life is environmentally friendly and would significantly improve the climate crisis if people from 1st world countries began to live minimalistically. 
  <br><br>

In my personal opinion, the idea of living on only the fundamentals is extremely appealing, considering how it would reduce the stress and anxiety of daily life. If more people began living minimalistically, they would also lessen the burden of having to maintain with society. Perhaps, with the looming danger of climate change, people will begin to live more like Thoreau.

In Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” he explains all of the benefits he comes across when making the change into his simple lifestyle. Although he did explain these benefits thoroughly, I felt like he could have gotten to the point a little faster and more concise. There is a lot to take home from his book, but if he wants many more people to read this and actually be interested he shouldn’t have droned on for so long about not as important things.
  <br><br>

But to get to what the book is really about, I think it is a great piece that focuses on consumerism within so many people. About how he can avoid and choose to stay away from being materialistic even for a short amount of time. It kind of goes along with the film “Materialism” in the sense of finding happiness not in buying new things but with what you have and appreciating it more.

I agree with your comment that Walden should have gotten to the point faster than he did. I found it extremely interesting when Walden talked about how we work really hard to be able to afford luxury items that are not necessities in our lives. I never thought about it in this way, I always thought the goal of working hard was to be able to afford things that I can’t afford right now, but if I don’t need these things that why should I spend most of my life working when I can spend it enjoying my life. I know many people that work so much that they barely have any time to spend for themselves or with their families. While some work this way out of necessity to pay bills and put food on their table, some do to be able to afford luxury items. I hope that one day I will be able to not worry about money to pay for the necessities and be able to spend time with family instead of working. Some may say you need money to live a fun life and although I agree you do need money, I still believe there is a way to make enough money to support you and your family and not have to work 24/7. We live in a society that tells us we need to be able to afford luxury items to be able to feel successful, but I don’t think that is what we need to be happy.

I am impressed by how Thoreau could continue to live in a minimalism lifestyle for two years. Personally I had experience living apart from human society for only two weeks. That was during a summer break and I went to Tibet, not for lower my footprint but for a mental therapy. On the first day, sleeping in a tent, drinking lake water, and counting stars every evening drove my insane. Living in a less civilized style is like quitting cigarettes: its dam painful and hard. But what is the outcome? After that I start to appreciate what the modern society has today. Most people just take things for granted as if the steaks are born from the grocery store and the vegetables are grown in the supermarket. We have always failed to think where do our products come from. The chapter Economy shows that minimalism is not impossible to achieve. You can improve your mental wellness and lower your carbon footprint at the same time. But I think doing so does a little impact to the climate change issue. Living like a minimalist is more of a spiritual self-realization and confession rather than solving the problem. We need more people to admit that we messed up the climate. It is not necessary to deny our civilization like we owe this planet something. The planet is not a life being. Instead, we owe the next generation an explanation for why we f*** up their planet.

I studied Thoreau in high school under the context that he was a transcendentalist author. Thoreau was an interesting character because he believed that his knowledge of the world transcended what he could feel, hear, taste-he wanted to understand the world in a deeper sense. Thoreau connected with nature, such a human experience, and rethought 19th century consumer culture, questioning whether big houses really meant happier lives. While his decision to live minimally on Walden pond was a bold choice, I think that there are small changes that we as individuals can make that have a huge impact that don’t abandon everything material in our world. 
  <br><br>

One huge very doable change is switching, like Thoreau wanted us to, to a more plant-based diet. We’ve been over the impacts of this on large scale outcomes. But more importantly is to reconsider consumption culture and to limit our quantity of items. My friends and I have only recently begun a kind of challenge amongst ourselves to reconsider what items bring us happiness. Instead of buying ten cheap things that’ll break and end up in a landfill, we’d build one thing that’ll last. If we can’t build it, we’ll save up for it, and in doing so (building or saving), the happiness that the object brings since we had to work for it is so much higher. Quality over quantity in every sense has led to a more fulfilling life.

I also studied Thoreau a bit in high school during our transcendentalist section in english class. We discussed various authors from that time period, but Thoreau was definitely one of the most influential. Reading excerpts from his novel (including the first chapter), I studied that during the late 1800’s advanced, transcendentalists were looking back to nature for means of self reflection and protest against the rise of Unitarianism. When I first read it, I connected to it in the sense that with all of the technology we are surrounded with in the modern world, it is good for people to connect to nature and not get lost in all the distractions. Now, reading for the second time in this class, I see the text in a new light. It is interesting that a novel written almost two hundred years ago can so closely relate to the environmental issues of today. The way in which Thoreau discusses how living a more simple in order to feel a stronger sense of purpose and self is exactly how people now should live when trying to live more environmentally friendly. I like how the above comment addresses how they have realized that it is important to think about the things you buy. In the past, I was always one to not want to spend a lot of money on things like clothing and jewelry, so I would buy them as cheap as I could find them. However, due to their lack in quality, they end up not lasting and I have to buy more. I realize that this was extremely wasteful and I ended up spending more money having to rebuy things. Now, I try to only buy things that I know will last in order to reduce waste. Making the shift away from consumer culture is what everyone should try to do for the betterment of our planet and our well being.

Although I was confused by the seemingly somewhat off topic reading upon first glance, after reading Thoreau’s accounts of living simply in, “Walden,” I was able to realize that this piece of work was extremely relevant to the themes of the course and turned out to be personally very influential. Coming from a community obsessed with material things and extravagance, I would never think about doing something so far from what I know. Some of the things that we know as necessities happen to be luxuries in the lives of so many others. As stated by Thoreau, “Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.” I’ve really never thought about the things that we think we must and will have can be done without. Just growing his own vegetables and eating such a simplistic and limited diet reduced his footprint on the earth by such a large personal amount, and yet most would never consider it. Having a fridge full of varying ingredients to produce a range of different huge meals every day always seemed to me like a normal thing, but as we all saw in reading this, it’s an entirely dispensable lifestyle choice. This lifestyle, however, does serve to only make us more greedy as we see people living like this always searching for more. The root of greed lies in what we already have as it seems only to make us desire something better or more. This need for more is the positive hindrance he describes to the elevation of mankind, and although this is so easy to escape, almost no one will because we consider it a necessity, not a wish.

A quote of David Thoreau from the Walden which I strongly believe still holds true to this day and I would argue that it also encompasses his sentiment through the text is that man “has no time to be anything [more] than a machine”, he goes furthermore to say, “the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation”. I interpret this as saying that man at first voluntarily subjected himself to labor-intensive jobs to become economically stable, then it became more about the need to climb up the social-economic classes but now it has become more of a normal and customary thing to do because, since the industrial revolution, society has been shaped to be workaholics. For example, the education system has taught our generation as well as those before and after us that if you work hard enough you will be compensated with your dream job thus working won't feel like working. Therefore as young children, we are being shaped into becoming “work machines” because we are expecting something great after so many years of work. I know of someone who declared himself an economic major for the only reason that that specific job will earn him a lot of money someday. I believe that money should not be the only motivation to do something because at the end of the day this person is going to look back in life and he might think that he wasted his time pursuing something materialistic. Therefore as Thoreau mentioned people do become trapped in a miserable life. Although this is true for some people, others who seek jobs that they do gain some form of satisfaction, this doesn't really apply to them. Thus these people live a life worth living. So as you can tell our generation has a choice to continue with the lavish lifestyle of the past or branch out into living a happy and fulfilling life with something worth their time and effort which might or might not earn them a lot of money but that's not the point, the point is actually living.

Henry David Thoreau stresses the importance of living a life of minimalist desires and tendencies in his book, Walden. He states that most men in America live their lives consumed by the things they worked so hard to purchase. They suffer through physical and emotional hardship only to find that perhaps what they wish for isn’t the happiness and fulfillment they seek. We may believe we are free, that we are given the choice to work hard and attain all that we desire but it is not true freedom. We do as society tells us, especially as Americans who are taught by our families the ideals of the American Dream. Me personally as the daughter of immigrants I was taught that I was so fortunate to belong to a country with so much opportunity and prosperity. I looked up to my parents who started at the very bottom and became successful business people. My life up until college was solely about getting into college. I never stopped and asked myself, is this truly what I want? To put myself in debt for an education that takes a toll on my mental and physical health? To obtain a job so that I can make money and pay back my debt and the debt I owe my parents for the sacrifices they made for me?  It is only until I arrived in college and found individuals like me that I realized that what I truly wanted to do is travel. I would love to live a life with only the “necessaries of life”; healthy meals, beautiful views, good company and a roof over my head. I do feel like I am an indentured servant to my society and my own expectations of myself because I know that my dreams will likely only be dreams. I will eventually get tired and want better meals, new views and people and a better place to stay. I will want more and more stuff. I fully believe in Thoreau’s statement, “Nature is as well adapted to our weakness as to our strengths”. Our unrelenting strain on the Earth’s resources is like a disease that our planet cannot rid itself of, we as humans are the problems that plague the Earth. However, at the same time we are the only cure, the only solution to the problem. By teaching the younger generations not to make the same mistakes as society did in the past is the only true progression.

In Walden, Henry David Thoreau explains this idea of a simplified lifestyle and how life truly should be focused around the basic necessities, like food, shelter, clothing, etc. In many ways, he is right, and this ideology should be right, but ironically in today's modern society, we do quite the opposite, just as the film Minimalism explains, we buy in hopes of it making us happy. Thoreau explains how this lavish lifestyle filled wth luxuries is just much more complex work, for things and materials that are highly expendable. Why work more for something that you truly don't need, or will even benefit you in the long run. I was completely drawn in by the peace and pleasure in Walden, that Thoreau inscribes through the simplicity of a minimalistic life. 
  <br><br>
Walden isn't attempting to attack this ideology of consumerism or lavish living , but much rather explain the happiness and the true delight of living such a minimalistic and simple life.



</p><hr>


<p>

In Henry David Thoureau’s, “Walden”, Thoreau begins the first chapter of his tale-telling novel with his take on a simplistic life, criticizing the economy and the people - which is a majority of the world population - to succumbing to creating a positive feedback loop of the world’s materialistic economy. He emphasizes the values of living a life that lacks the materials that people believe are necessities, but are ultimately not. With the house the size of a garden shed, or his low payments, or his absence of excessive spending, Thoreau proves that the bargain made to attain simple content is one that people should always consider. 
  <br><br>


Something that I found really interesting is the idea of clothing. Even in Ken’s video, people that buy new fashion are described as “monkeys following the lead money,” spending money unnecessarily to fit in with the newest fashion and trends. And no more prevalent is this topic than in the contemporary world. Today, everyone - from teenagers to adults to little kids - are obsessed over the new trends that the fashion industry feeds out because they feel the incessant need to fit in an attempt to be cool (which, as I type this, sounds a bit paradoxical because one cannot be cool while fitting in at the same time). However, Thoreau helps to prove that functionality of clothing is not correlated to the motivation of purchasing them for their style or the instincts to fit in. Reading this section made me think a lot about how literature from years past can still apply to the present society, and it makes me wonder what if Walden were to be published today? In a world where trends reign supreme and the minimalist lifestyle is starting to gain traction, would Walden’s philosophies make a big enough impact to shift people’s perspectives into living a lifestyle of simplicity, which could in turn cause people to turn towards a more climate-sensitive lifestyle. 

  <br><br>

When I think about the simplistic lifestyle, I think about a philosophical argument that Peter Singer brings up. He says that once we have gained all of our basic necessities, the extra income that can be used is not significant in our fulfilment of further happiness. When people bring up that idea, I immediately revert back to living the minimalist lifestyle. We don’t need all of the things that we have. And yet, because we are fed the idea that we need clothing for style over functionality, that we need expensive material items to be living the best life that we can, then our idea of what becomes essential is taken away from us; clouding and diluting the judgement of what is important and what we can live without. Now, that is not to say that I attribute to this philosophy. I definitely have fallen into the cycle that I have just described. However, what I will say is that it makes material things seem less significant in that you distinguish what you need versus what you want. Whenever you make a decision as such, such as what clothes you buy or what car you want to drive next, ask yourself that question, because it is a constant question that I continue to ask myself whenever I am thrown into the same scenario. I guarantee that the amount you spend - both from your wallet and of the planet’s resources - will be significantly less.

In my opinion, throughout this past quarter, I find it easy to agree with the reasoning behind these lifestyle changes in response to climate change. However, agreeing and actually doing are two different things. As the class progresses, I continue to wonder if I could actually make these life changes. On the other hand, that’s what I enjoy about this class because we are able to understand the history behind our lifestyle and how it can be possible without extremely disrupting business as usual. As you mentioned, this really highlights the idea of what you need versus what you want. Obviously, there are many that are not willing to live in a shed sized home, but as shown in the documentary, it underscores how we really can afford to live in smaller sized places. 
  <br><br>
 Thoreau would probably be hopeless of his cause because during his time, it would be more possible to live in his situation, and nowadays, consumerism is much more extreme. In today’s society, the normal or more desirable lifestyle is big houses, multiple cars, and fancy clothes. I think it would be much harder now to simplify at Thoreau’s level. However, I also think he would appreciate those who do live a minimalist lifestyle in present terms. He would probably be impressed at functionality and modernism of tiny house, since his own home could be considered a tiny house during his time.

I holistically agree with your judgment about the idea of clothing. However, I think that calling people “monkeys following the lead monkey” has inherently become too lenient in this day and age, for people have surpassed that level of stupidity. People are like brainwashed children eagerly following trends blindly without any source of conscious reflection on whether what they are doing is correct/ logical at all. For example, the new trend of ‘hype’ is one that even prior to taking this class never really stood well with me. I didn’t understand why people were standing in line for hours and hours waiting for the simplest shirt with a red box on it and the brand’s name. People spend thousands on simple, invaluable items that not only don’t make sense environmentally but also financially. Therefore, with the advent of the “hype culture”, not only are people craving to have the limited edition plain shirt with a logo on it to look cool but because the supply is much lower than the demand, it also becomes a sort of adrenaline for people to try and get their hands on the limited edition shirt, shoes, bags, etc. I feel like we’ve seen and heard about so many contemporary epidemics like addictions to gambling, phones, PlayStations, etc. But we haven't really heard about one addiction that I believe affects most Americans in a great way: retail addiction. Their constant need and yearn to have the newest, latest, coolest item has not only begun to dictate their spending but also their happiness, as they start to believe that expenditure on a  shirt that will probably wear once or twice- then it loses its value- dictates their happiness. One other thing that infuriates me about the retail/ commercial industry, in particular around hype is the amount of waste that gets wasted. For example, I read that in order to maintain the ‘exclusiveness’ of the Yeezys, Kanye West or whoever, used to actually burn the excess shoes that did not sell in a certain period of time, thus maintaining the hype around the product. 
  <br><br>

I think that Henry David Thoreau's, “Walden”, is an ingenious piece (or at least its first chapter is) that tackles the notions of consumerism, self-indulgence and overindulgence showing the stark disparity between those behaviours and the minimalistic, simple life that he lives. I think that if this book was written in this day and age Thoureau’s criticism of consumers and the economy would be even more critical than what he has already written, because of the deterioration of society's moral and personal standards of living. Thoreau really exemplifies how material wealth does not in any means dictate one’s happiness and contentment in life. Someone can be happier and more pleased with his life living in a tent in the desert, than some wealthy individuals that are essentially nomads hopping from one house to another around the planet. In fact, those who always want more and more and more will never be satisfied in life and will always crave happiness that they can never achieve because in our extremely capitalist era today new products no matter how obsolete and useless they are, will continue to be produced, and thus people will seldom want the newest and more up-to-date item.

In response to your commentary on the huge following fast fashion and trendy apparel has, I agree that it is easily overhyped and stems from our society's growing "need" for validation.  Thoreau makes a good point about only really needing a few items of clothing that will be long-lasting and functional in his first chapter of "Walden."  His efforts for a minimalist lifestyle are commendable, but in my opinion, challenging to follow in an industrialized 21st century society.  Though it is understood, not all of Thoreau’s practices are to be taken literally, his criticism of the materialistic economy and those who participate in it, is to me, a bit short-sighted, seeing as most of the world’s population participates in such.  As long as the majority of people hold value to materialistic items like fashion, expensive cars, or lavish homes, the pressure to purchase these gold-ticket items will always be present.  Just as there will always be a market to supply those things to a population that demands it.

The part where Thoreau made reference to Confucious’ saying, “to know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge,” really reminded me of the fact that many humans are unaware of the effects climate change is having on the earth, disregard anthropogenic climate change, or fail to believe in it in general. With this, the older generations of the world such as Baby Boomers and Generation X seem to be the ones who do not want to understand what they do not know, nor want any part in knowing the truth about climate change. It has been known that it is more difficult to change a person’s lifestyle and perspective on a topic if the person is part of the older generations. They have lived much more life than younger generations, of course, but with this comes a fixed mindset on the world and how life should be lived. That includes what in life is deemed as “successful” and “right.” 
  <br><br>

It was also very interesting to read about how man first perceived fire as a luxury, and that luxury has turned into a necessity in today’s world. That comes to show how the world is both evolving and also taking for granted the given gifts of the earth. Thoreau elaborates on how we do not even “need” fire (fuel) to begin with when we already have the proper shelter and clothing, yet humans continue to use fire as a popular resource. Nowadays, humans use fire for production and many other carbon-emitting actions, when fire should mainly be used for keeping oneself warm or cooking. This reading was very eye opening to me because I did not realize the majority of the basic necessities are things I take for granted. I take such things for granted because I do not recognize them as being a “luxury” in the first place. 
  <br><br>

Speaking of taking things for granted, reading the part about humans acquiring clothes just for the novelty and other people’s opinions reminded me of social media/reality star Kylie Jenner’s lifestyle, and those of many other famous individuals. From what I have seen on social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter, Kylie posts pictures of herself at least five times a week, wearing a different outfit every time. Imagine obtaining numerous articles of designer clothing that is most likely worn only once a year. She practically has enough clothing to wear a different outfit for each day of the year… Not one person on this earth should be this powerful/wealthy, and not use their money towards change that can benefit our planet. I slightly strayed from the initial topic here, but that is my mini rant.

I personally also found Thoreau’s “Walden” to be a very intellectual/meaningful read. In today’s society, we’ve become so dependent on materials. Kids are growing up thinking they NEED phones, fancy clothes, games, and therefore these have become a “necessity” rather than a luxury. We’ve redefined the word “necessity” so much, and things are considered a “need” rather than a “want” at this point. I completely stand with the fact that this is a cultural and social problem. Yet, there seems to be no way to reverse it. Thoreau’s philosophy on a simplistic lifestyle where one is with nature is a spiritual, yet hopeful journey. He heavily emphasized that having simple homes, natural sources of food, and peace was all man needed. Unfortunately, we didn’t stop there. We wanted and craved for more. As a result, both man and the planet are now in trouble. I definitely think it’s important to realize that even though Thoreau raises good points, mankind would most likely never be able to achieve this. Big corporations would never allow it, too much money is at stake, and it is now an ingrained lifestyle for millions of people. At this rate, it seems unlikely that this would be reversible.

In the first chapter of the book Walden, Thoreau has stated a life style that is minimalized and simplified, which food, shelter, clothing, and fuel are four necessities humans need. He claims that people are pursuing luxuries that are meaningless and not required to a basic life. The clothing or fashion industries was criticized by Thoreau because they are providing things which are not necessarily required by humans. I think this is an impressing lifestyle which both benefits people and the nature. Apparently, using fewer natural resources is beneficial to the planet, and by keeping our life simple, we may not be overstressed to earning unnecessary things.

Yeah, I definitely think there is a great beauty to simplifying one's life. As Walden says, people "are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them." We care too much about over working for things that are not necessities that we render ourselves unable to enjoy any time we have off, often choosing to worry about how we are going to protect all of the inessential material goods. I think individually we need to take actions to simplify our life to the point where we can still live and function within the current society while not being swept away by the trappings of such a society. Going all the way to a cabin in the woods seems too extreme too most people, but there are definite steps that can make life much more manageable.

The chapter of economy is the beginning of Thoreau's solitary life at Walden Pond. Thoreau proved by a primitive way of life that a great philosopher must be the most destitute in material wealth and the richest in spiritual wealth. He objected to the luxurious life, and stressed that all material things except the so-called necessities of life would become a burden to the spirit. By his own hand, the author built a wooden house on the edge of Walden Pond. In the absence of a kitchen, cooking in the open air has also become a kind of pleasure. Only the most basic necessities of life: food, shelter, clothing and fire, people can live well. The author is advocating a simple life. My biggest feeling is not to judge other people's lives. No one can define life or its role models. Each has his or her own purpose and desire. Life is not easy. No one way of life is one hundred percent right. No judgment, peace of mind is good.

Reading about Thoreau's life was very interesting. I think he was ahead of his time in understanding that we don't really need all these extra things our society pushes to feel like we need. I think that by sacrificing these material things we may be happier and be able to be more social and empathetic towards one another. Personally, without so many distractions I think that I could be more productive and focused on the things I need to do. Overall I think that if we needed to forget most material things and live life at its simplest we could easily do it and it would have more benefit that hurt.

After reading the first chapter of Thoreau's "Walden", it becomes clear that the commodities around us bind us to a over-complicated lifestyle. Fundamentally, Thoreau asserts, all humans require are basic necessities: shelter, food, clothing, and fuel. This lifestyle is arguably better for both the environment as well as the individual. Many people are overworking themselves to achieve meaningless commodities that are not absolutely essential to maintain a simplistic lifestyle. Such a lifestyle also lowers the total space and footprint of the individual, hence helping humans create a more sustainable lifestyle for the years to come.

Henry David Thoreau's "Walden," is a reflection on the fact that independence is more valuable than neediness, in terms of our financial and interpersonal choices- independence from pressures of following the timeless path set by our predecessors. This literary piece is perfectly suited for the themes we are addressing in this class, specifically consumerism. Modern society propels the consumerist principles. We attribute our developments and success to our accumulations and expenditures- our contribution to society, yet with all our success and innovations, progressively improving our lifestyle, we fail to recognize we are only progressing in the expense of our natural resources. Self-reliance is the main lesson that I got out from this reading; producing more than consuming. Furthermore, recognizing the fact that it is not through our works that we progress but it is through the value of our existence. 
  <br><br>

Every year we impress ourselves with new developments, making every factor of our daily interactions slightly easier. Thoreau poses this question to me:  are those interactions supposed to be made easier at the expense of our planet. For example, have we ever thought that washing clothes was supposed to be an excessive task, a task that requires energy because it was originally done by hand. With our technology today, you use up more energy playing chess than washing clothes, thanks to boujee washing machines. Thanks to the electricity that powers it. Thanks to the countless hours, resources, and energy, that was released to produce and deliver that technology to your door. horeau identifies only four necessities: food, shelter, clothing, and fuel, not electric powered appliances. Yes we should be grateful. We have these commodities, at the expense of our planet.

After reading Thoreau’s Walden, I think it is fairly obvious that the foundation of modern minimalism is not only a relatively old concept (as Ken discussed in this video) but may well lead many people to a more satisfying life. By considering which factors of one’s lifestyle are wants as opposed to actual needs, it would seemingly be an easy decision to significantly reduce consumption. Since this consideration still applies as strongly to the United States as anywhere else on Earth, I also think that it is important to reflect on Thoreau’s reflections on vegetarianism. In my opinion, this was best highlighted by the anecdote about the farmer who “needed” meat because it had bone-building nutrients juxtaposed with his ox which had perfectly strong bones on a vegetarian diet. In more depth, Thoreau basically utilizes this story as an example of privilege. Once again tying back to Ken’s notes as well, there is an inherent expectation essentially at birth that you will live a life comparable or “better” than that of your parents. Not only is excessive consumption ingrained in our society as a mark of success, but providing the same for children is often seen as a mark of good parenting. Keeping that in mind, we can look back at Thoreau’s discussion of the fact that different people are raised with different expectations and see that most of what we consider “success” from a property/ownership perspective contradicts the behaviors that we will have to emphasize to realistically combat climate change. As a final note, I also thought that it was interesting the way that Thoreau incorporated the actual data surrounding his building/eating expenses. He really laid out all of the details one might need and, even accounting for inflation, a minimalist lifestyle is definitely a far more cost-efficient way to live in addition to being an environmentally friendly one.

I completely agree with your comment about excessive consumption. Even though minimalistic lifestyles are becoming more popular especially among my generation, I still see a large desire in my peers to make a lot of money in order to have a lavish adulthood. Regretfully, even though I try to live as sustainable a life as possible, there is always the thought at the back of my head that I need to be doing more in order to get more later in life. I don’t think it’s our fault that we have this almost innate drive to consume. I do think, however, we more than anyone need to be acutely aware of this drive and need to work on combatting it within ourselves as much as possible. Of course it’s alluring to dream of having a big house and a fancy car, but it is not necessary and it is not as important as previous generations have lead us to believe. It would be tragic to throw away all the beauty on Earth for these temporary markers of “success.” 
  <br><br>

I do hope that more and more people can see the importance in the way of living outlined in Walden. Because overconsumption is so ingrained, especially in American society, I think it will be a hard cultural obstacle to overcome. I do have hope though, that as the climate situation worsens people will realize what is most important. As much as it is said, I think it’s hard for people to fully grasp the idea that money does not buy you happiness. Simply because of the way we have been raised, people can’t escape the idea that consumption will lead to satisfaction. I think an extremely important concept in Walden is that minimalism can lead to true satisfaction with one’s life. It’s hard to convince people of this truth and my hope is that more people give a minimalistic lifestyle a chance and see if it works for them.

When reading Henry Davd Thoreau’s “Walden”, I was honestly confused in the beginning, there was mention of slavery and just some history I had to double check I was reading the right thing. As the chapter progressed I began to understand a bit more, consumerism was mentioned and it was a bit surprising. The mention of this idea in the 19th century is really interesting because it can still be seen today, very widely around the world. We have become more about spending and showing off what we have as well as wanting what others have. Most people today desire to get big houses, more clothes, be able to pretty much buy whatever they want.
  <br><br>
Ken and the books mention of these things not necessarily contributing to our happiness I agree with. This is especially evident when Thoreau mentioned the “savage” homes vs the “civilized” homes. Literally being civilized is what was fucking people over (idk if I can curse but I just did…). The homes of the “savages” were much cheaper so they were able to afford to own them. They might not have been like the common homes we have today but it was a place where they could be protected from the rain and the cold which is all we need to be protected from. The “civilized” had luxurious homes, they were also bigger but they could not own them. The fact that to be “civilized” we have to literally be in debt just to live like everyone else is so outrageous. Honestly though that is how it is here in IV. All the homes are so expensive to rent and you need like 10 people in a tiny home to get a reasonable rent price, yet they limit how many people you can have so you're forced to pay a lot and I cannot because I AM POOR. They are literally taking advantage.  
  <br><br>
Seeing how much Thoreau spent for his home was surprising and unbelievable, but I mean at that time it was way cheaper. However I just went to volunteer at a place that literally sells used and new home appliances, furniture, literally a lot of home stuff for cheaper and this idea doesn't seem too bad. Getting used things and just living a more minimalist life wouldn't be so hard to do and we would be helping a lot more. We might even be happier because there are less things to worry about when living a much simpler life.

I agree that I was also confused at the beginning and, to be completely honest, I found this reading extremely hard to follow all throughout. I was reading the same paragraph over and over again trying to understand what it was saying. Perhaps I just get distracted easily, but I couldn’t understand the author’s rhetoric until I read and discussed this with my roommate. Because of that and Ken’s video introducing this reading, the only thing I really took away from this reading was that it’s okay to live a simple life. Based on the other comments (as well as yours), I suppose I’m right about that being a takeaway. Anyways, in regard to what you said about consumerism, I agree that we see it all of the time today. I connected this with last week’s lecture and how Ken said we have to grow and learn that materialistic things do not equate to happiness. In the beginning the author brought up questions people asked him, and it stuck with me (probably because it was the few things that didn’t put me to sleep lmao). The “do you ever get lonesome?” made me think about how much we question those who don’t live in luxury. As a low-income student, my family lives in a rather small apartment, and when I would meet people who lived downtown in large studio complexes they’d be questioning how I never feel confined in my small home. 
  <br><br>

This mindset of needing to have more to be better than the next person is such an unhealthy idea. However, as I mentioned in one of my comments last week, those that are poor long to have big homes, the newest tech, etc. Living a simplified life becomes complicated when you come from one that is looked down upon. I definitely see myself living one in the future but it isn’t even that simple when you consider that the cost of living is very high in general. Maybe if I could build my own home I would. Because we see people living lives full of wealth and luxury everyday (i.e. through social media, celebrities, etc.) it’s very hard to willingly simplify your lifestyle unless you can truly commit to it and not be influenced to give it up. It also helps if you live in areas where a simple life is encouraged (I want to move to Sweden one day because of this). 
  <br><br>

Overall, I can’t really comment on the reading itself too much. Were you able to take anything else away? I would love to discuss it with someone so that they can help me gain more from it because it makes me a bit sad that I literally couldn’t :(

<br><hr>

I am glad to know that others were confused by this reading too. At some points I found myself rereading sentences multiple times just to grasp what he was saying. When he started talking about slavery I had to take a minute to think about when this piece was written and under what circumstances. When Thoreau started mentioning consumerism I felt uneasy realizing that this issue has been prevalent for a while. Back then it was different because we weren’t even close to how developed we are now, but Thoreau lays out how the need for more extravagant and expensive things was an issue then. And he explains how this can be an issue because “Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.” 
  <br><br>

The “savage” homes vs the “civilized” homes that Thoreau talks about is very relevant today! Although it has seemed to have gotten worse. Then, the “savage” homes were cheaper and thus less quality, but they could buy it. And the “civilized” homes were big and fancy but cost a lot so they could only be in debt in order to have it. This pushed the focus on having better things than other people even if you can’t afford it. But now our “savage” homes are still unaffordable to so many! The wealth inequality is bigger and so are our issues. My parents have never owned a home and never will because of how expensive it is. And I liked how you connected that here to IV. We are forced to pay even higher prices which makes it impossible to live in comfort. People can’t afford to rent a house unless they can get 10 people to live with, they have 4 people living in a garage just to make ends meet. This isn’t how it’s supposed to be. It was never meant to be like this, but Thoreau shows us how deep rooted this issue is. 
  <br><br>

Something that struck me was when he said “Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor.” It got me thinking for a while. It’s not necessarily the case that the less you have makes you wiser or happier. However, having less would make our lives simpler if we aren’t subscribing to over consumption, and maybe that declutter of our things could declutter our minds and give us new wiser perspectives. Of course we won’t know until we do, but I appreciate Thoreau’s piece for allowing me to see the history of our actions in order to find ways to prevent it from repeating.
<br><hr>

for me reading "Walden" reminded me a lot of my philosophy readings in high school. Although he did present a problem it seemed more like he was advocating a life view, not necessarily to solve a problem but to break loos form a polluted system. A system that then went on to become the standard for the western world. Consumerism and therefore capitalism has never before been bigger and although people try and be more conscious about things this mostly involves buying 'other' stuff as compared to not buying stuff at all. I think  like you stated the consumers standard in our society is deeply intertwined with the social mechanisms of being validated. The image of a happy life is almost inseparable  with having a lots of money. And this stereotype gets validated by everything we see online, celebrity culture and the lifestyle that is advocated by the more fortunate in our society. For us to take  a step back the biggest issue in my opinion is making is social desirable to own less rather than more. It is as much an issue of convenience as it is a perceived convenience.

<br><hr>
I wanted to comment here because of where you mention how Thoreau mentioned “savage” versus “civilized.” The “savage” lifestyle is looked down upon by some and ridiculed because of the connotation that the word savage has. It is incredibly sad because of the fact that we now call the people who only live off of resources they need and have the bare minimum savages. “Civilized” lifestyle has been built up so much and advertised in many ways to countries, especially like ours, that it has become the ideal lifestyle, and, as you said, it is not really a feasible one, it is one that we only try to achieve because society and life tells us to. I think that we should not make a separation between savages and civilization because it is just different levels of civilization that people choose. If more people saw living minimally as a viable option that wouldn’t make them “look bad,” it would really encourage others to live a life of less without thinking they have shame.
  <br><br>

In effect, this takes away the stigma of having less can really cause people to change their mindset about objects. When people today realize that living in a small house and having the bare resources that you need to live is a GOOD thing that can positively impact the world, it will really influence more people to start following this trend and include it in our so called “civilized” life.


<br><hr>
I also agree that it was very confusing in the beginning and found myself having to go back and reread lines several times. But then, I also continued reading more and started to understand it a little more. He mentioned several problems in society and many of them which are still relevant to today's world and society  which actually surprised me. One of them was the mention of consumerism and how people just want to have the latest trends but in reality, their life does not feel fulfilled because they are all just material things. He also mentions how when you want something and you attain it you are not fulfilled but just continue to desire something better. One of the things I found interesting was when he mentioned how one is more likely to go to town with a broken leg, then with patched up pants. He says “Often if an accident happens to a gentleman's legs, they can be mended; but if a similar accident happens to the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for it; for he considers, not what is truly respectable, but what is respected.” which is also what happens in today’s world, especially with the access to social media and other online media. People want to look a certain way for other people, but since they are not doing it for themselves they end up living a miserable life. For example, social media and how it only shows the good parts of people’s lives, yet many people outside of social media are struggling and unhappy. Overall, it just sets unrealistic expectations for society. There are times where I want to try and live a minimalist lifestyle because I feel that it would probably make me a lot happier and less stressed about the things I have and do not have, but it also seems very hard giving up a lot of things.


<br><hr>
Like you I was so confused in the beginning I was not sure if I was reading the right part. I also found the book a bit hard to follow. The language was difficult to follow. Although I did find it interesting that this minimalist mindset was already being practiced hundreds of years ago. This lifestyle seems so crazy to us, and almost impossible, like can I really just find an untouched area and live there. I find that to be a bit difficult right now in these times, but maybe I am wrong. But even if you can't go to this measure, just making small changes to progress can lead to a whole new lifestyle. 
  <br><br>


A line that I seemed to reread throughout the chapter was how men are the owners of men. Men hire men to make money, men wear and structure their life to impress men, like Thoreau's explained with fashion. First men need men to hire to work for them to make money and to consume. We then desire these luxurious clothes to impress other men. In the chapter there was a part that said how a man would rather walk out with a broken leg than a patch on his pantaloons. It is a bit crazy to think how these ideas of society are still so similar now. We love fashion and we love to consume it, but what benefit does having a full closet of clothes you never wear bring you. I myself face this struggle, I see something I think looks nice and I want it. But I really have to ask myself "Do I NEED this?" This is the question people need to ask more.
<br><hr>

I really feel your frustration with housing in IV. I am going to start my adult life already in debt up to my eyeballs, because even with a roommate, I pay more for one quarter of an apartment than my cousin in Kentucky pays for her entire apartment. And the thing is, even when I am able to move away from here, I will still probably pay almost as much because my family is from coastal southern California, and I don't want to move away from them. The society we live on is all about unsustainable growth. People want everything bigger and better than it was before, no matter what it takes. Rent goes up but out paychecks don't. I wonder if it is because we are so used to struggling that we as a society always strive for more. Our ancestors struggled to find food and shelter, and now we feel we aren't succeeding unless we are also struggling for something. 

  <br><br>

I also noticed how Thoreau mentioned that he spent very little money during this time. In our modern world, spending money is practically a requirement of living. We can't live off the land around us because the people who own it won't hesitate to kick us out. In fact, living off the land just isn't something most of us even know how to do. We are trapped in our post-industrial capitalist society with no choice but to pay up or die, pretty much.

<br><hr>

I really appreciate your reply to Walden. I think that you mentioning the terminology used in the book about "civilized" vs "savage, and the way in you acknowledge that is important. This idea of civilized life is toxic and a product of colonialism. With that being said, I too having read this before (in ENG 22) still find it so hard to read and keep up with. He talks about how 'luxury enervates and destroys nations" is something that has been made clear to us by this week’s materials. I find that statement true after what we have seen this week, and that luxury is not a necessity, and is taking over people's concept of how life should be. I also found it interesting the way Thoreau called out the factory system by saying that it doesn’t care about mankind, and only care about enriching themselves as a corporation/factory which still stands true today. We see the way POC, WOC, and immigrants are exposed to harmful working environments by factories that don’t care about them as human beings and don’t pay them half of what they deserve. This is also evident in the way factories are placed. They are placed in predominantly POC low-income communities (environmental racism), and completely disregard how the health of these communities are affected by the factories. To name one in my community is Farmer Johns in the city of Vernon, and Vernon in general. Vernon is a factory city surrounded by inner cities. This is just one of many topics that I saw in Thoreau’s book that are still issues today.

After reading "Walden" by Henry David Thoreau's, I too was intrigued when he mentioned "savage" vs "civilized" homes. For over a century, we have had these ideas where it is not seen morally correct to be just like everyone else. In order to be "normal" , you must have top high-end clothes and live in a somewhat luxurious house. You must also have a nice phone for example, if not, people automatically assume you’re poor immediately which may not be true. 
  <br><br>

I think its ridiculous how our civilization has evolved this way. Humans have become so judgmental, but mots of us don't even realize it. As Thoreau mentions, it is evident that the savage owns his shelter because it costs so little and isn't complex compared  to the civilized homes which can include a variety of commodities like clean paint and paper, back plastering, blinds, nice locks and doors, many rooms and bathrooms, along with many other things.
  <br><br>

I myself can vouch that it is extremely hard to own a home because of the extremely high prices just like the ones in IV. I live in a house with 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, 1 kitchen, and 1 living room. Just for this, we pay a total rent of 5800$ which is ridiculous. There are places throughout the country where you can pay as low as 600$ for something exactly the same. It is crazy how they take advantage because were in college and need a place to stay.

<br><hr>
Interesting that you bring up that “we have become more about spending and showing off what we have as well as wanting what others have.” Many people would say we are part of a “consumer culture” where buy things and wanting things, have become a part of our identities. Some would dread at the idea of being called a person who doesn’t buy the hip and latest clothes or the latest technology. Although the good news is that more and more people are open to using recycled goods and secondhand clothes and furniture. Unfortunately (I hope I’m wrong), many people are treating the idea of living a minimalist and eco friendly life as fad rather than a lifestyle change. Thoreau goes through some interesting speculations during the first chapter of his book as he lives his minimalist lifestyle away from industrial society. He begins to think himself and his own impact on the world around him, as well calling excess luxuries “hindrances.” I hope that the people who treat this plant based, recycling, minimalist lifestyle as a “fad,” become aware of their impact on climate change and others around them. Thoreau constantly talks about observations he has about farmers, laborers and even himself, and that’s the way we should all think about various things (such as climate change.) People forget that climate change affects the people we indirectly put to work, our neighbors, families, friends and ourselves.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with this statement and the comparison to IV. Thoreau truly opened my eyes to how civilization is in a way corrupt and makes mankind work like machinery in order to enjoy basic things. Things such as housing, especially in IV, the rooms and apartments are cramped and the number of people living in one area is absurd. The prices are unreasonable and we work so hard in order to be able to afford this small piece of shelter; whereas, Thoreau was able to attain this for much cheaper just by moving away from civilization. 
  <br><br>
I believe that if Thoreau saw how people were living now he would be appalled. Humanity is farther from nature than ever before and lifestyles are only getting more intricate rather than simple. I do believe that as a new generation, we need to accept the idea of a simpler lifestyle and put this into motion. It would not only benefit the environment, but also our happiness. Looking at people in my family now all I see is them doing is worrying about work, finances, and what to buy next. The mentality of consumerism has been rooted so deep into society that it has overrun their lives and happiness. I know people that only keep themselves motivated by planning vacations and events, as having something to look forward to is the only thing that keeps them happy in this lifestyle. People should be living most of their lives content and happy, not looking for other motivation to keep them going.

<br><hr>
I agree with this so much. At first I was so confused I thought I clicked the wrong link, the whole story made no sense to me. In a way this does relate to IV. The pricing for housing is ridiculous and they take advantage of college students. It makes it hard to live and I have to work my butt off on top of school just to be able to afford the living cost down here while still sharing a room with two other people. In the reading it is so weird to me that they considered the civilized rich who had big fancy houses and the ones who didn’t savages. I feel like that’s just such an intense way of describing them.
<br><hr>
I agree with a lot of your points. I think Thoreau analyzed his current society appropriately and would be even more fueled if he experienced how we desire more extravagant and wasteful use of housing, clothing and food in means of marking success. I agree his word choice is outdated, but his theories still apply to the present. His point about luxuries being indispensable and a hinderance to the elevation of mankind very much describes our current consumer culture in the U.S. and its relation to climate change. Evaluating what is "necessary of life" as Thoreau describes is an important step for ending the "debate on climate change," stoping behaviors/companies that progress climate change and hopefully reversing the effects of climate change. I actually went to Goodwill in downtown SB this past weekend to go look at what is there and saw SO much clothes and other household materials that are (1) in good condition for reuse and reduction of waste and (2) so much cheaper than what you would pay in stores new– a win-win situation. I bought some cool books there for 99 cents each that would've retailed for over $40 and may have ended up in a landfill if not donated to Goodwill. Also moving around so much, usually with just my two-door car to move everything I own, has taught me how to live minimally during my time here in SB. I can definitely say is it less to worry about and feels less materialistic. I think Thoreau's points from the 1850s are definitely still applicable to our lifestyle in the states today.

<br><hr>
I agree with your viewpoints on how people view living “civilized” versus living as a “savage.” In our current time in the US, living civilized means having a large house, a nice car, brand-name clothes, and the newest version of the iPhone. Living savagely means having a small apartment, biking to work, and wearing second-hand clothes (this is not considering people who are homeless, but that is a different discussion for a different time). Our society isn’t just about getting things, its about getting new things. Say you want a purple sweater, most people will go buy a brand new purple sweater when there are plenty of good ones at the thrift store just because they don’t want something used. Like the chapter states, “our skeletons, probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors,” meaning that none of our possessions truly matter, they do not make us who we are.
<br><hr>
In the first chapter of Walden, Thoreau described his experience of moving to Walden Pond for two years and two months. By interpreting this experience, Thoreau is promoting the benefits of living a simple life. In other words, Thoreau is hoping us to only keep the things that are important to us and abandon those are unnecessary. For Thoreau, he only kept four items- food, shelter, clothing and fuel. However, from my point of view, I think this is just a different lifestyle chosen by different people, depending on their family backgrounds, socio-economic status, and their fortune. For example, Kim Kardashian chose to live a famous and wealthy life and that is because she is able to and she has to. Given her job and her income, she has to live under the flashlight and keep up the fashion trend all the time to maintain the public’s attention one her and her family. From another perspective, she chose this lifestyle which is the opposite of minimalism probably because of her childhood history the divorce of her parents. This may tell her that the only thing can give her sense of security is not a man or herself, but money. In the other hand, the family background of the author may choose the lifestyle for him – a simple and self-reliable life is enough. 
  <br><br>
To be honest, there is one undeniable benefit of living a simple life- decrease in carbon emission. It can be deduced that living on necessary amount of food, shelter, clothing and fuel only causes lower carbon emission as the author is not using cars and not buying excessive amount of clothes. Given the climate change we are having right now, this lifestyle is certainly helpful if the majority of the public decide to live this way.

<br><hr>
I agree with you. I too was confused with a good portion of the reading, but my main takeaway was about consumerism and living a more minimalist lifestyle. It is crazy to me that this was a problem during Thoreau’s lifetime when the book was written in 1846. I can’t even imagine what Thoreau would think about life today as consumerism runs our world. One quote that really stuck with me was in regards to consumerism, “Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.” I think this is really important because most people believe owning more stuff makes them happier when in reality it has the opposite effect. This is especially prevalent in today’s society as we are consumed by media and comparing ourselves to other people and what they have. Many people focus on how other people live, for example, the Kardashian and Jenner family. Kim Kardashian has 159 million followers on Instagram and constantly posts about the extravagant lifestyle they live. It’s the whole “I want” mentality where people want to have what she has, which is equivalent to having a bunch of stuff, no matter the necessity. I think now more than ever people calculate their success based on how big their house is, how many cars they have, etc. People need to be reminded that living more simplistically makes people happier and also has positive impacts on our environment as well.

<br><hr>
I like how you said that it was possible that we might enjoy life more without the clutter, especially with the film assignment for this week where they proved just that. Thoreau was honestly ahead of his time when he realized this, and it’s sad that more people weren’t so eager to even attempt his challenge. Luckily, just like you with your dreams of volunteering at a place that sells used furniture, I feel as though many of us in this generation are dreaming of more simple lives, and actually taking hints from Thoreau instead of ignoring him. This simpler life, lacking clutter that we don’t care about, will be leave more time for us to be able to focus on the things we do care about.

<br><hr>
I was a bit confused at first if I was reading the correct thing and then I was like...well this is in the english department. Anyways, I agree with you on your "savage" and "civilized" comment. It is weird that somehow the "civilized" people were/are doing more harm and acting more savage-like than the so-called "savages" themselves. I believe these "savages" took the time to, as Ken said, ponder what we value in life. As a society, this is what we all need to do. I know that what we value is deeper than what we think we long for--fancy cars, clothes, houses, and...just like...stuff. It's time to change this standard of success so we can lead better lives for our environment but also for ourselves...our happiness. People don't believe that this simplistic lifestyle can make them happy. How can it not? Work less, leisure more! How can we know, if we aren't willing to try? Someone mentioned this phrase Thoreau writes in previous comment, but it is vital that we take the steps for the "experiment of living". 
  <br><br>
I had to snap when Thoreau said, "The luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot; as I implied before, they are cooked, of course Ã  la mode." We have more than we need and more than we want. Even for me, I constantly feel like I am in a tiny closet packed with styrofoam--useless crap!

Similar to you, I also found myself confused and lost in the start of Walden surprisingly. Having had read this during a previous quarter of ENGL 22, this reread was almost refreshing and I found that with every reread, I am exposed to more findings within the text. It is embedded in lots of pop culture songs and even literature for desires of big cars, big rings, big houses- I’m literally referring to global sensations including that of Korean-pop band BTS, who had a song that included those very lyrics. It is recognized clearly that the more things you have seems to be associated with the likes of a better life. I really like your response here in that you pull out the importance of Thoreau’s description of what his home is like. He lives the ultimate standard of a minimalist life and yet gets by. You mention that we might even be happier with less things, and this once again draws upon a reference in my memory to Marie Kondo and her pushing the narrative to only keep the things that really spark joy in our lives. Walden explains the benefits of a simplified lifestyle, and even for someone like me, who is eager to clean out clutter from my life, is hesitant at such a big shift in change, letting things go when I initially at first instinct do not feel ready to...this is a text that paints a picture of a lifestyle that only a select number of people have converted to or desire so far. It could be quite surprising to see if more people were to experience this experimentally, and see if they actually find a liking for this change in lifestyle. Definitely, a very big difference from the pushed idea of success and happiness, but I would not be surprised if a great number of people found the positivities within this sort of minimalist lifestyle.
<br><hr>
I was also surprising at first about the lifestyle of Thoreau had. His home was so simple that I had not imagine before. After reading Walden and hearing Ken's video, I realized that people might feel happier if they choose to live only with necessities. When people do not buy those that not much valuable to them, they may be have a totally different feeling. Their mentality and spirit might change as their life goes simply. Under that situation, people may not have some troubles regarding the relationship between each other. This reading also connects to the movie "Minimalism". When more and more try to live in this way, our world might change a lot as well.

I like this article so much, and I really agree with what the author said. As Thoreau described, “Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meager life than the poor.” Those luxuries and many things are not necessary for us at all. These things are useless and waste natural resources. But there is still a lot of people who choose to do it. And we, this generation, can't blame the older generation, why don't they save the planet and make the population or hope the next generation to fix the problem. We have to fix the problem with us, this generation. We can't wait or blame others. The only and the best way to do is to fix the problem by us and no more delay.

I've been thinking about this quote-- “Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meager life than the poor"-- and I genuinely wonder if it's true. I... don't think I necessarily agree. 
<br><br>
It is romantic, yes, to be minimalistic. There is a heartiness to it, a peace. But... goodness, I don't think I can agree with this quote in its fullest. I like having a comfy couch and bed. They don't make my life worse, they make my life better. I like having fast internet. I like having fancy food with interesting spices. Maybe I misunderstand the quote; maybe it is exclusively about true excess in the form of random baubles and fast fashion and fast cars. But when people live in a truly ascetic, Spartan manner, they forego most modern luxuries. I think this is a mistake. 
<br><br>

Epicurus, I think-- and I know I keep repeating "I think"-- really had it right. He does not reject pleasure or luxury: he understood that pleasure is what we all seek, and we should seek it where we can. But he was, still, not a man of extravagance or waste. He was a proto-utilitarian, seeing pleasure for all as the greatest good of all. Not egotistically hedonistic, he still knew that great cheese and good wine was a route to genuine happiness; he knew that luxury was a boon, not a burden, and that these luxuries can be used while truly making one's life better. 
<br><br>

This isn't to say that we should all be overconsuming and indulging ourselves too fully. But to say that luxury is a burden... well, I just don't buy it. I'd much rather argue that we can be both responsible and luxurious at the same time.
<br><hr>

The quote that you bring up is one I’m struggling to either agree or disagree with. It instantly makes me think of Gandhi, a man who lived a minimalist lifestyle and was able to still live a happy life. Part of Gandhi’s reasoning behind his minimalist lifestyle, however, had large political and religious motivations behind it. It makes me question if Gandhi would have really enjoyed a minimalist lifestyle had it been purely out of free will. Similarly, many of us commenting on this video saying that “Walden” and this class have inspired us to become more minimalist are being driven by the motivation that it’s part of what we need to do in order to save the planet. While I don’t disagree that reducing our consumerism habits will have a positive impact on the planet, it can’t be ignored that we probably wouldn’t be doing it if we didn’t have to. It’s not shameful to admit that we enjoy luxuries we don’t necessarily need. This is part of why I struggle with the part of the quote saying that luxuries and comforts of life are “positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.” I can agree that they’re unnecessary, but I can’t say that they’re necessarily hindering mankind; at least they weren’t, until the older generations took advantage of too many “luxuries” which now forces our generation to relinquish them.

After reading Walden, I found that a simplistic lifestyle is really appropriate and should be advocated especially among students. As many college students are still depending on their parents financially, it is moral and responsible for them to live an easy life. Fewer impulse decisions would be made if we really follow that kind of lifestyle and it is going to reduce the financial pressure on our parents. Instead of buying dozens of jackets and shoes and leaving them in the closet without wearing them for years, we can save that money for future needs.

Though I do agree that it is effective to spread this knowledge to college students, I don't know if they are necessarily the best demographic to focus on. I acutely recall reading an article prior to coming to UCSB sharing how moving to college could be a time to practice minimalism (sometimes out of necessity) and was excited by the opportunity. I had already learned a bit about the minimalist lifestyle and wanted the chance to really pursue it in college. Regardless, I do agree that it would help college students-in their pathway to independence- start a life of their choice and also that is friendly to the planet. 
<br><br>


From reading "Walden", this quote struck me: 
<br><br>
“Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and cooked food; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire, and the consequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the present necessity to sit by it.”
<br><br>
It's really interesting when I think back to what the word "natural" really means. I sometimes fear supplements, pills and other forms of innovations when it comes to health, because I fear the artificial and potentially harmful substances that come with these creations. But when I think back to some of the things I consider natural--I would not think of cooked food as natural, and yet generations many many years ago used to eat food raw before the discovery of fire. It is hard to tell what is a reasonable use of past innovations and what is a sign of going to far. We see examples of "going to far" in stories like Frankenstein, which--without a doubt--would evoke fear in most people in our current generation... So where is the line?


<br><hr>
I also thought about college students as well while reading this. While looking around my dorm room I think of what a minimalist living style that I am living right now. With mostly only the necessities. Of course there are a few things that are consumer goods, but for the most part it seems pretty simple. Especially with today's housing crisis and economy, it only makes sense for this newer generation to live in smaller houses or apartments and live a more minimalist lifestyle, whether they like it or not. I feel that most of us don’t exactly have a choice if we want to live in a big house or not, unless we all move to Texas or Oklahoma or somewhere where the housing prices are less expensive. I think that most of us are becoming less consumerist and more conscious about the things we buy. I think that this shift is very important because, although most of us were brought up with thousands of toys and some electronics, we are starting to realize that we will be happier with the connections that we make to people rather than tangible items. I also think that Thoreau was very much ahead of his time, and his book rightfully became popular.

I feel like all of us reading this should feel a sense of irony. Even though we are all college students living in a relatively cheap way in terms of environmental consequences, we are all working for the goal of having a job where we can make a lot of money and afford the luxuries of life. 
<br><br>

A vast majority of college students are living in a sustainable way right now, but we are all going to a good college and have goals of making a lot of money later on in life. For example, a large percentage of the people that I have met are Biology majors. Most of these people definitely don’t have a passion for health but want to be a well paying job later on in order to afford luxuries that make us happy.
<br><br>


On to Thoreau, I do agree with the moral that he is trying to express to his audience, that we don’t need many of the luxuries that many man are working for to be happy, to a point. I find myself second-guessing myself before I buy anything, asking “Do I really need this?” and most of the time, I really don’t. However, I also believe that having the ability to buy things that make us happy or having the ability to do things that make us happy are essential to being human. We can’t just limit ourselves to living in a shack in the woods. His Walden experiment is an overly-extreme way of communicating a point that I believe hurts his point more than helps it. 
<br><br>

He continuously almost looks down upon working men: “Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.” 
<br><br>

My view when reading this quote is that many men work in order to be able to do things that make them happy. The sad fact of the matter is that our society is run by money, and that in order to do many things you need money. The vast portion of society cannot give up everything and still be happy.
<br><br>

Because of this, I have chosen to look at the argument of Thoreau with a grain of salt. We do not need many of the luxuries that so many of us buy, like a second or third car, but doing things like having the ability to join a tennis camp(something that makes me happy) still require an income.
<br><br>

In the last lectures Ken Hiltner also gives the example of living in communal homes as getting rid of a luxury(having a large home). But living in a communal home or living in a very small home limits so many aspects of ones life.
<br><br>

It may sound like I am completely against getting rid of luxuries in return for helping the planet, but what point I am trying to say is that we should only get rid of things or not buy things that doesn’t give us direct happiness of will not lead to anything. Such as expensive watches or more cars.

Your point is spot on, I cannot agree more with you. Throughout Ken’s lecture and Walden, I have this weird feeling, I am told that the book should be “right” and we should look up to and follow Thoreau’s lifestyle. But the more I’m exposed to this minimalist lifestyle, the more I feel restricted and closed in. Your opinion is almost what I have in mind. 
<br><br>

I think instead of the ultimate truth, minimalism should be one of the lifestyles people can choose. Having free will is what makes us human, to most of us, we love a fancy Audi or Porsche, some people love cars and put more value on to his(her) car, hence he(she) would choose to spend more money on a car. Other people might love big rings and dazzling jewelry, they may spend their money on that. In a way, having something on one’s wish list is what pushes people to work towards it. If everybody does not need this and that and lives on the only basics, humankind would not progress. Imagine Einstein became an extreme minimalist and thought “I don’t need to spend my money to get an education and use up extra books”, where would we be right now?
<br><br>

I believe that what we should not do is to let greed get the best of us. The bottomless, soulless, and obsessive, compulsive pursuit of excess luxury should be avoided. You don’t need a pair of $4000 Balenciaga shoes if you are working minimum wage and barely affording rent. But who should buy these ridiculous shoes, you may ask. The rich people, say they earned their money fair and square, spending $4000 on a pair of shoes is completely normal for them. They could, use this money to help people in need, but it is their choice and they have the right to choose where their money goes. After all, this is how the world works and it has been working most of the time. 
<br><br>

So yes, think twice on your next amazon purchase; reflect your recent life from time to time, take your choices responsibly. Living this way might not save the planet, but at least I know what I’m living for.


<br><hr>
I am terribly sorry to be the one to tell you this, but I believe you may  have missed the actually point of Walden. This work is not simply Thoreau complaining that people work too much and want too much, rather he is stating that because they work so much, want so much, and even own so much, they are less content with what they have. The idea of Walden is that a materialistic lifestyle leads to people being less happy with the simple things in life, and less grateful for what they have. If an individual were to live in a small house and grow their own food, make their own clothes, and build what they need, they will feel a greater sense of accomplishment than an individual who bought them from someone else, after working a job they did not like to get the money. You state that living in a small home limits the aspects of ones life, yet the only aspect it limits is how much you can keep in the house, not how content you are in that home. Having grown up in the current era, I'm can understand the way you feel, but I must question if you have lived in a small house and if so what the limiting aspects of this house were. You also state that you choose to take the work with a grain of salt, yet your reasoning is that sometimes you like to pay for things like tennis camp. While agree that tennis camp is fun and that it costs money, it is not materialistic, and tennis can be played with other individuals without the need to pay for a camp. No object can, in fact, give you direct happiness and i believe you missed that point.

This reading seems to be more philosophic than realistic to me. The author made a lot of allusions to historical and mythological stories to appeal to the importance of staying simple, plain and minimal. However, many of his arguments are suggesting an “original” way of living rather than a simple way of living. For example, he implied that we should embrace the physical landscapes and avoid the urban centers as much as we can, so he encouraged us to build our own houses nearby the tranquility of nature. In addition, he also implied that new clothes are not meaningful but wasteful, as a result, he called for thrifty and simplicity and implied that we are only able to achieve success with only old clothes and minimal items, just like what those historical heroes and mythological figures been through. I do agree with part of his arguments, in the sense that people nowadays devoted their entire life to earning money so that they are able to equip themselves well with materialistic lifestyles, such as big mansions, expensive cars, luxurious items. Moreover, I agree that the tranquility of nature brings us peace, relaxation, rejuvenation to meditate and re-collect our energies. Nevertheless, these ideas aren’t really applicable to our modern society, given the circumstance of every individual. How realistic it is for a person to build his or her own house in nature? How realistic it is for a person to almost give up every item he or she owns to cater to this minimalist lifestyle? Of course, I’m sure some people will be able to adapt to this lifestyle, but is there going to be a big difference though? Suggestions like those aren’t working in this modern scenario. We, as concerning global citizens, could only minimize our carbon footprint to be the best extent we can, without having to adapt to such extreme changes that would totally off-throw today’s world.

Thoreau's writing style feels rather philosophical and unreal, also known as hard to read, but it's amazing that what he writes still applies to today. Even if Thoreau does advocate a simpler lifestyle, I feel that we should focus more on why Ken wants us to read Walden. He's not asking us to follow Thoreau's example, especially since going out and living in the wilderness would harm the environment more than help it, but asking us to think about Walden and reevaluate our lifestyle. Walden doesn't focus on climate change, but about living a better life. Much of what Ken wants us to read or watch follows a similar theme: how living in an environmentally friendly way will also improve our lives and make us happier. Minimalism, the documentary for this week, is really similar to Walden. I think we'll also be watching Happy, a film about different types of lifestyles and happiness. I agree with you that it's not realistic for everyone to give up our stuff to "cater to [a] minimalistic lifestyle," but even Thoreau notes that he's targeting the people who are unhappy with their current lifestyle, which is almost the majority. Even if everyone doesn't choose the minimalist life, there would be significant effects if some people do. We should remember that every person has influence and that we can vote with our dollars. Other people have mentioned that Minimalism, the documentary, only applies to wealthy people who can give up their materialistic lifestyle. Yet, Minimalism and Walden both remind us that we have a choice. We can opt for a more minimalist lifestyle, and that minimalism differs for everyone. It's not about "[giving up every item he or she owns to cater to [a] minimalistic lifestyle," but about how we can rethink our lives and live in a different way that benefits us and the environment. Living environmentally friendly isn't a chore, but something new.

People always say that they spent some of their happiest years in college, and I wonder if that has anything to do with not having as much “stuff” and living (at least somewhat) minimalistically. Housing options already push us towards a minimalist lifestyle, but continuing to do so would help us save time, money, and space, all of which I am sure we could all use more of. After having lived in the dorms for a few months now, I can say that, as far as space, it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I have everything I need to comfortably take care of myself, and I don’t really find myself wishing for all of the extra beauty products, clothes, and “stuff” I left behind at home. It’s also a lot easier to keep things clean and not be overwhelmed with everything extra - leaving more time to study and be with friends. If we continue to live at least somewhat minimalistically for the rest of our lives rather than giving into consumerist culture, I wonder if we could carry some more of that happiness (which I truly believe comes from having extra time to spend with people) into the rest of our lives. 
<br><br>
I think this is what Theoreau was trying to get at. Without having extra, unnecessary stuff, we feel more free, more happy. However, I think the biggest takeaway from “Walden” is that Thoreau gave up most of his materialistic possessions with just the intention of living a better and happier life. He didn’t do it for anyone else or even the environment. If he was doing it to just be happier, then by pursuing a similar lifestyle, we wouldn’t be “giving up” anything, would we? Helping the environment would just be an added benefit, rather than the intention.

I really like the way you connected the lifestyles we live as college students to Thoreau’s experience in Walden. We often do not realize that, despite everything we might be limited to by living in the dorms, we still manage the space and our belongings well, even when sharing a room; even the convenience of having personal automobiles seems more irrelevant while we live near campus. There is a part where Thoreau explains this scenario: “It would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier life, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are the gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them.” The realization of making conscious decisions in what we buy and keep hits hard when we move into college dorms because we conclude that it simply is unconventional and too expensive to bring everything with us or continue to buy new things. Consequently, we are encouraged to live more minimalist, sustainable lifestyles that seem still stressful due to classes but also less physically cluttered, which is one less problem to worry about.

I can relate to your comment about living a more minimalistic life by attending college. When I was at home, my lifestyle was much like the everyday person Thoreau mentioned in Walden. I had collected about 18 years of “stuff” that honestly did not hold much value in my life, yet I continued to keep out of habit. When college began, I then realized what was really needed in life. Daily necessities, clothes, a bed, and some pictures were some of the only things I actually brought, leaving behind at least 75% of the things I own. This was surprisingly easy. 

<br><br>

I too believe in Thoreau’s argument that living a minimalist life will greatly add to the happiness in one’s life, mainly because I have already lived this feeling. As I mentioned, it was very easy to decide what to take to college. I knew I would only need the essentials and not much else. To reference your statement, I really did not feel as though I was giving up much. If anything, I felt the relief of living in a more simplistic environment. I believe that this is the feeling Thoreau was trying to convey through Walden and the best part is that he really gave us the guidelines to imitate his lifestyle. While we will likely not live to the extremes as he did, I know everyone has the ability to take on some aspect of his lifestyle, which would be more than enough.

I made similar connections after reading and watching this weeks material. I find myself feeling less hectic and in a more peaceful environment when I’m in my dorm here at UCSB than I do when I am at home. I was not looking forwards to on-campus dorm living before coming here, but now I enjoy it and miss it when I visit home. Here I have only things that I need and are essential to my daily life. At home, all the extra and unnecessary things tend to make me feel overwhelmed and I feel the need to constantly clean and reorganize. Having a clean and simplistic space here in my dorm has definitely had a positive impact on my mental health. I also find myself using the bus here and riding my bike here more often than I have in my entire life. I think people should live in circumstances similar to ours before assuming that living minimalistically is extremely inconvenient and uncomfortable. Theoreau emphasizes the impact that living minimalistically can have on one’s overall quality of life and I think if more people were more open to the idea of minimalism they would see that this lifestyle can be rewarding. I agree with how if people saw minimalistic living as a personal lifestyle choice for the betterment of oneself, its positive impact on the environment is just an added plus. However once again I’m not sure how many people would be willing to make that change.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with this comment as by applying Thoreau’s concepts to our own lives, we are able to understand the concepts he is trying to get at much more. In comparison to last year, for almost all of us, we all reached a much more minimalistic lifestyle. In the dorms, we have much more limited space and storage for all of our materialistic belongings. And yet, we are still happy like Mira said above. This and Thoreau’s book both show how humans can be happy without belongings and even find our “true selves”. While we will probably never do anything as drastic as him, building a cabin in the woods and living without materialistic goods, we can still see how much good it did for both him, and the environement. For him, psycologically, it was an experiment, but it gave him so much satisfaction. He was able to turn profits off of just his hard work and what the earth provided him. He was able to go through his time in the woods mainly relying on himself, which I think is such a bewildering concept yet amazed me so much. 
 <br><br>
In respect to how this chapter relates to our class, I think it’s important to think of how much smaller of an impact Thoreau had on the environment during this time. By relying on himself, one could say he almost went back to the hunting and gathering time as he provided food, water, and shelter for himself. However, even with that he had still had a slight impact on the environment. But, if you look at the opportunity cost of him doing this, we can see just how much smaller it was. If he hadn’t conducted this experiment, he would have been living a normal life, which we all know has huge environenmental impacts. By doing this, he accidentally had a way smaller carbon footprint. If we applied this to our lives, but on a smaller scale, we would be able to reduce our environmental degredation and still be happy. This showed that we don’t really need materials to be happy and if we all just cut back a little bit, it would make a large impact on the earth.
<br><hr>
The connection you made between our current lifestyle and Thoreau's lifestyle was really thought provoking. Before reading your comment I had not realized how much of a change I had made when coming to UCSB. I went from sharing a room with my younger sister to living in a quad with four different people and trading In my car for a bike. Although it doesn't seem like much, over time it does lead to a decrease in our carbon footprint. If everyone followed Thoreau's lifestyle I do believe that rampant consumerism would come to an end. Thoreau was an activist and not only took action in changing his lifestyle to be minimalistic, he also protested slavery by not paying his takes for six years; “I was seized and put into jail, because as I have elsewhere related, I did not pay a tax…”  Although this might not have been the most effective way to protest he did have good intentions. Thoreau also argued that a minimalistic lifestyle would lead to an increase in happiness as one lives a life with less worries. Ken asked the question of whether we could see people volunteering to make similar changes than Thoreau's and I would like to say some people are already doing so by moving into tiny houses because they are trendy, it might not be for the reasons we want such as to help the planet out but they are making a change.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with you. People in this century are all so caught up in their lives; working so hard just so they to be like what they wish to be like (or being like other people/what other people are portraying on the internet), no matter the price they have to pay, how much pressure they are going to get, and, even for some situation, how sick it is going to be like. Materialism is rooted in our lives for so long that it is hard to be taken out. I think it is important to know, just like what has been said in that chapter “ I think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do. We may waive just so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere”. If we care less about how to be like someone else than we do now and get rid of the “consumerist culture”, wouldn’t the life we have, not thinking about the trendy things that we want to follow or the multi-functioned whatever technology we want to have,  be so much relaxing? If we all give ourselves a break from these frequently introduced, and fast-evolving products, will the environment still be dragged down by those “trendy things” people have been pursuing?

<br><hr>

I agree with your comment that we’re honestly currently experiencing a minimalistic kind of life. Here in college we have to budget ourselves to make sure we have enough money for our monthly expenses. Well at least for me it has really helped prevent me from making unnecessary purchases. All we need in all honesty is just the basics: food, shelter, and clothing; as long as we have those satisfaction is ensured in my life. Everything else is just an extra pleasure added to our lives. We are already trying out that simplistic life in “Walden” as we changed our old lifestyles to come live here in the dorms. I changed from a home to a smaller shelter, and with less objects here with me. It has helped me value things even more now and has made me realize that maybe I don’t need as much to be happy. Materialistic possessions come and go, sometimes they decay without using them to their limit. Maybe switching to a “Walden-like” lifestyle doesn’t seem so bad after all.
<br><hr>
I really like your analogy using the typical college lifestyle. For most, transitioning to a small, shared dorm room is a big change from the life we led before, but it is a change we all adjust to. It makes us realize that we do not need all the extra space we have become accustomed to. We have proven we can manage just fine without the many luxuries, yet still insist on retreating back to them after college. But if we can live, somewhat, minimalistically now, why can we not continue to do so both for the benefit of the planet and our happiness?

After reading the first chapter of Thoreau's book "Walden", I thought of how much different my life would be if I practiced the lifestyle he preached in the book. I do agree with what he said in his book, which is that living a minimalist back to nature lifestyle would make us happier. There is so much more to worry about when we live in the mechanized world of today. We chase after luxuries, and when we do that, we have no time to enjoy what we have right now. We spend all of our lives working towards what we define as success, which we define as luxuries that we think will make life more enjoyable, but is really just causing stress. If we lived the way he preached, all the extras that causes us worries would not exist and we can just enjoy life. Seeing that Thoreau was distressed by the housing of 1850s, Thoreau would probably hate living in the world we live today, as it is just like the life he tried escaping in the 19th century, only even more mechanized.
 <br><br>


Thoreau challenged us to reconsider the life that was scripted for us, the generation before us failed this challenge. The generation before us followed the script, which resulted in massive environmental damage. Ken says that we can not follow the path the generation before us went through, and he is right. It will be challenging, for this means going against the expectations that have been set up for us, but we must try, otherwise we will continue feeding into the cycle that is destroying our planet.

Just wanted to say I love that second part of your comment. It's been a fat minute since i've read something like Walden and was finding it extremely hard to keep focused and draw parallels to the topic of climate change. Much like in both the Minimalism  movie and lecture video on electric cars, I found there was this push for us to change how we think about spending our resources and our approach to living. Thoreau's perspective on consumerism and experience at Walden pond do feel a little skewed and subjective in my opinion though. It's easy to look at his take on humans and their "savagery" and immediately feel a disconnect. That's exactly what i felt initially. 
 <br><br>
What? Live in solitude, in a confined space? Eat and live off just the fat of the land? Heck no. 
 <br><br>

I took some time after reading to reflect on the reading and read through some of these comments and I couldn't help but feel intrigued that Thoreau's overall message does, in fact, resonate with what we are trying to achieve today. Through his detailed descriptions and meticulous documentations of the economic side of his lifestyle, we can observe a very simple fact that I feel like the United States has yet to realize: we have options. We have options in how we can live, how we use our free time, create more time, create more efficient ways of using resources and achieving happiness. In the situation of our climate crisis today, there are so many ways we can help out the planet by simply tweaking how we live. Its easy to be discouraged by the somewhat extreme stance (in my opinion) Thoreau took, but as long as we start heading in that pathway and stick to it, I begin to feel hope in mitigating climate change. 
 <br><br>

To end off, I just want to leave this quote from Walden: "It is by a mathematical point only that we are wise, as the sailor or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his eye; but that is sufficient guidance for all our life. We may not arrive at our port within a calculable period, but we would preserve the true course."


<br><hr>
This idea of finally reaching happiness when one rids themselves of material possessions has been a major theme of this weeks readings and videos.  Thoreau does a great job of creating an outline for the minimalist movement that has taken root and spread in todays society.  I agree that he would be very upset at the consumer culture that is the American society in the 21st century if he was criticizing 1850s America who did not have nearly as many things.  He would have similar points about giving up unnecessary additions and burdens to our lives such as big houses, imported food, and fashion trends. 
 <br><br>

What he also points out that I never really thought about was how many people are living well beyond their means in order to keep up with the continuously changing trends of our consumer culture.  He says from the very beginning that he has "no doubt that some of you who read this book are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out, and have come to this page to spend borrowed or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an hour."  He addresses the debtors directly because that is a huge target audience for his work.  He wants them to become self aware and to take a step back from their stressful lives of trying to keep up appearances and buying things that they can't afford, and to let them know that they don't have to do that.  Society and large corporations may try and convince people that they need to have the coolest new widgets or follow the best new trends, when Thoreau is assuring them that no, they don't.  They can be happy with what they have and do not need to be constantly searching for more.

<br><hr>
I had the exact same thought as you while reading the chapter of "Walden". At first, I couldn't even imagine living the way Thoreau did. I assume most people today would feel the same way. We can't forget that the book was written in the mid-1800s, which is why it is so scary how much of it still applies to our present life. Thoreau mentions that living a simple life is "hindered" by all the noise around us, which I definitely agree with. Especially in the 21st century, it feels like the world is constantly moving and encouraging us to do more, buy more, consume more. It is hard to block out all the noise from our society and culture and simply listen to our own voice. We are deeply influenced by the media, society, advertisements, our environment and the people we surround us with - often, it is seemingly impossible to not let it all negatively impact our lives. In a way, living in nature, away from all the noise and chaos of the city, seems pretty desirable.
 <br><br>
As you said, I would love to know what Thoreau would think about our lives today. Now more than ever, we need people like Thoreau to remind us that living a simplistic life, surrounded by nature, would probably reduce a lot of our stress and worries.

 <br><br>

At first, I was unsure why Ken assigned "Walden" as this week's reading, but now I think I have made the connection to climate change. Thoreau emphasizes that we really only need four necessities in life - shelter, clothing, food, and fuel. Being born into a family that can offer you all of these things is already an immense privilege and should not be taken for granted. Sadly, our culture is characterized as always longing for more and never being fully satisfied. A lot of the causes of an increase in greenhouse gas emissions stem from this belief. Excessive food, cheap clothes, big houses, fast cars. None of these things would be part of the minimalist lifestyle that Thoreau chose. Maybe this is supposed to be a wake-up call for us - we won't find true happiness in all of these things. Not only are they useless to us, but they also strongly harm our environment. If we want to improve all of our lives, we need to focus on what's really important and valuable.

At first, I didn’t understand why Ken would assign Thoreou for this week’s reading. It had nothing to do with anything we talked about previously, and I had to do everything I could to stay engaged. It took me awhile to read through its entirety– and even then, I still didn’t understand its purpose, what it had to do with the class, or what it was even about at all. After watching Ken’s video lecture about the reading, my mindset changed. I soon sat down and wondered why I was so quick to judge and how fast my perception changed. Why was I so quick to judge how another person lives their life? If they wanted to live minimalistically, why did I care so much or even have an opinion? After having these realizations, I skimmed over Thoreou’s piece again with a clear mind. I then understood what Ken was talking about and saw how living opposite from societal standards can make you even happier. Although I do not completely agree with throwing all of your belongings out and living out of a backpack, I understand the different persona those take when they decide what is truly important. He managed to find happiness and comfort out of literally nothing, and even though I know that I’m not capable of such a thing, I respect it and admire it. I understand how hard it is to completely let go of everything you once knew and live opposite of how the world tells you– yet, Thoreou still did it anyways and it made him a better person, not only for himself, but for the future of our planet. As Ken says, Thoreou challenged the role he was given at birth and rewrote his script according to how he wanted to live. He didn’t care about what others would say– he put his values, his future, and his heart first, and it made all the difference.

I also had to change my perspective about reading this excerpt. Although tedious, I finally got through and had several major takeaways. One of the phrases that resonated with me the most was "it is never too late to give up on our prejudices." Ken wanted us to read this so we could see an example of someone rejecting the mold that was created for him. The role we are expected to fill is not sustainable for the environment or economy. We are raised to want equal or more than what we were given as we had growing up. "What are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to any other." As a product of an upper-middle class family, I have always been accustomed to having more than I needed and I never had to worry about where I was getting my next meal or new clothing. When I grow up and begin to have children of my own, I, of course, will want them to have the same luxuries as I had. However, I now understand through research about the climate crisis and now reading Thoreau's account of minimalism and simplification of life that materialistic items are not as necessary as they are created to seem. I most likely would not willingly throw all of my luxuries and live the most simplified life; however, I know I can cut down on buying as much or chasing the newest trends or biggest houses. Even in 1854, Thoreau called out factories for not having sustainable fashion, which can relate to now in fast fashion companies which exploit laborers and waste valuable resources. Walden's comment about returning the borrowed axe sharper than how he had received it is how we should view treating and preserving our planet.

After reading the Walden, I was impressed by the idea about backing to nature. Firstly, I think it is true that people should sometimes come back to nature and enjoy the simplicity of life. The author depicts the natural life as paradise comparing to urban life. Living in nature, everything becomes simple and peaceful. Everything in there is meaningful, and there is no consumer culture, which is like the minimalism. However, when I think again, there is another perspective. The author is like escaping from the urban life. Living in such peaceful life can weak one's motivation of life since there is no competition there. Therefore, backing to nature is beneficial when it is temporal and served as a breakpoint. In addition, urban life is the consequence of development, which is unavoidable. We have to face the noisy urban life and try to fit ourselves in it. Therefore, what I want to say is that the idea in Walden is beautiful, but the reality doesn't care about it. Trying to be minimalist in urban life is more practical and efficient.

When I was a kid I took a trip to Yosemite. My family and I were on a trail but we stopped for lunch. Our tour guid asked us a question that I’ll never forget: what are your goals in life? My answer was to be successful. He replied with, “is being successful more important to you than being happy?”. For a long time I’ve thought about this question and my answer. I’ve always thought that my definition of happiness was to be financially successful and to have all these material things my parents didn’t have. My parents came to this country becuase they were told that anyone can make it in the United States. That the United States can lift anyone from poverty if they just worked hard enough. I think Thoreau’s outlook on life is completely antithetical to notion that we as U.S. citizens are bought into. That with enough hard work anyone can make it this country. That anyone can reach the American dream. Thoreau is challenging the idea that consumerism is something that should make us happy. You know I asked myself why I want a big house, nice clothes, a nice car and every other material thing someone could want. And I find myself coming to the conclusion that it’s becuase society wants me to. I want to live this lifestyle to show others that I made it. That I’m accomplishing the American dream. But the American dream is broken. Too often do people fall in despair grasping for the American dream. And if anyone can truly make in this country then the problem isn’t with society it’s with themselves. We cling to material things as a way to express our opulence even if we’re poor becuase that’s the way our society values our worth. Anytime we dress up in fancy clothes or post a picture flexing our material things we feel better about ourselves becuase we feel closer to living the opulent lifestyle that the United States values so much. But it shouldn’t be this way and Thoreau shows us a different way. Simplify simplify. Now that’s something I’ll take to heart. We have to stop taking up the role that society has laid out for us becuase it ultimately doesn’t work for everyone and certainly not for the planet

I totally relate to your comment. When thinking about what a successful life entails, I often think about possessions- a nice house, nice clothing, a nice car. However, does that really mean that you're successful? It's a lot to think about because we grow up thinking that to be happy, we have to have nice things. In music, rappers talk about how they have 12 cars and huge houses in the Hollywood Hills. These types of stereotypes are the ones that perpetuate the idea that money equals happiness. However, after reading the first chapter of Walden, it makes it clear that it is possible to live a good life without having an excess of material possessions. In addition to this, not only does an excess of material possession harm one's mental health, it harms the environment. An excess of cars and a large house creates a giant carbon footprint. All in all, after reading this text, it made me realize that a lack of possessions might be the key to a satisfying life.

I believe that Thoreau was onto something in the sense that we do not need more things to have our selves a happy and fulfilling life. Early in chapter one, Thoreau stated “The necessaries of life for man in this climate may, accurately enough, be distributed under the several heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel.” This statement breaks down the main areas Thoreau changed his lifestyle to make his life easier and more enjoyable. Only one of the things that Thoreau did shocked me and it was his disconnect from a capitalistic society. When talking about housing and how many landlords are only rich because they are being paid for people to live in a place that they bought. If these landlords did not get any renters then they would ultimately be poor. Taking this risk of relying on others to purchase a product that you created is not always a risk worth taking. Thoreau spoke about a man who made baskets and when to him in hopes that Thoreau would buy a basket, however, Thoreau was not in need of a basket because he depended on himself to make one. This selling of products goes both ways because if Thoreau was to hope that someone would come by to sell him a basket but no one did, he would be out of luck. This plan of relying on yourself is one of the most successful ways to live but it also can be quite scary. When reading chapter one, I was shocked that someone could ultimately buy a home, rebuild it to his own standards, create a farm that could feed himself and a few other people, and to scavenge for food in the wilderness. This is not a lifestyle I could picture someone in the twenty-first century doing because it is so dependent on luck and your own determination. In addition, at this point in time, many people relying on retail to get all of the things that they need. They buy their homes, they buy all the clothes they wear, they buy all of the produce that they eat, and buy the things they use on a daily basis. The one thing that I think we should try to recreate out of all the things Thoreau talked about was wearing our clothes past the point of fashion. Often times, if the clothes we own are out of fashion or if they have a small hole or stain in it, we throw them away. Thoreau stated, “It would be easier for them to hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon” and I believe that this relates to the present day. If we were to wear our clothes just a bit longer then we would not be as wasteful and in a sense, our clothes would be more like a part of ourselves rather than an extension of the fashion industry. It would be nice if we all could be less reliant on a capitalistic society but I doubt we could become that way in less than a century’s time of pushing against the ways of our society.

I agree with your view that we should elongate the use of our clothing. Society practices fast-fashion which is unsustainable in terms of resources and economics. However I believe we can do more than just improving our clothing habits. All four of the necessities Thoreau mentioned can be practiced in a much more sustainable way. For instance we can turn to a mainly plant based diet. As Thoreau mentioned in Walden when talking about a farmer who claimed humans need meat, meat is a luxury in food not a necessity. If we limit and even cut out luxuries in our lives, we can make a huge difference in the sustainability of our resources. Similarly to meat, large houses, personal cars, and new clothes when not needed, are all luxuries we can cut out of our lives. This relates to the film we watched this week about minimalism. We should try our best to only consume and buy necessities. 
 <br><br>
Overall I was very impressed by Walden. Thoreau could see the problem with consumerism even back in the 1800s and decided to make a change in his life and reflect on his own consumerism. This only proves we have known about this issue for a long time and still chose to not improve our actions and live more sustainable.

After reading the first chapter of Thoreau's book, I found it interesting how people wanted to move towards a more sustainable lifestyle by moving out live in nature. It was if it was one of the first movements towards creating a more minimalistic culture, that personally I still wished was going on today. Instead of moving out to be more with nature, people are destroying it to make room for more houses. I really like his idea of only using what you need instead of buying in excess, or living in a house that is only big enough for what you need. I think if people brought about trying to live a more simple lifestyle, our environment would be a lot better off. People would not even have to make big changes, but just little things can make a difference.

Simplicity. Professor Ken brings up the question during his video if “We should all simplify”. The short answer is yes, but really who is willing to live how Thoreau did, in a small space and essentially to only have the necessities. I can assure you that not many people would want to live like that. It is just part of this American Dream stigma that mostly everyone wants, everyone wants to have something to show off. The bigger the house, latest fashion trends, and the car you have all have been factors of what social class one is. I think that once we can diminish that stigma we can finally talk about simplicity and living like Thoreau as an option. Fast fashion is disastrous for the environment, I think it is something as consumers we do not realize. Fast fashion is inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends which is also a major problem buying too much celebrities advertise many of these stores that are fast fashion and have an impact on people. We should definitely try to minimize the amount of meat, clothes, and car use in order to help the planet

I was surprised to find out that minimalism and Thoreau's transcendentalism is a theory proposed at such an early period in time. If the bustle nature of urban areas seem overwhelming to those in the mid 19th century, I can see why everyday life today is very difficult for people to handle. I'd imagine that Thoreau would  be completely overwhelmed and upset if he were to see how little minimalism is incorporated into everyday lives.
 <br><br>
 Thoreau’s mentions in Walden that, “Before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped, and our lives must be stripped..” which I think is important, as many people overlook one’s own essence due to the business and priorities that people have been socialized into. However, transcendentalism is in essence, escapism and though perhaps you may be able to ‘escape’ into a life of simplicity, not everyone can as they are merely trying to survive on a day-to-day basis. There is essentially no fundamental change in leading a minimalist lifestyle, other than changing your own lifestyle. In addition to this, you are not actively working towards changing the political undercurrent and the nature of capitalism which created and enables an overconsumptive culture. Essentially, transcendentalism falls short since many people do not choose to live a culture of overproduction and overconsumption, it fails to recognize the material conditions which bring upon the very conditions that he is fighting against in his work.  Therefore, capitalism is what essentially creates an alienated individual, the issue at core.

Yes, Thoreau’s life in a rural area does sound appealing, but it is only appealing, not radical in any way. Much of the planets degradation is created by a rich population who have both ownership to goods, production, and labour as we have read in class. For example, in Before the Flood, it can be argued that the farmers who use biodegradable fuel are ‘minimalist.’ But if we only focus on individual lifestyle, we overlook the atrocities that they are nonetheless facing because of global warming. The actions of corporations do not end if we inwardly fixate on ourselves and not others, as transcendentalism proposes. We must all look on beyond escapism, what good would be wishing for a minimalist lifestyle if it begins and ends in your own household? When the professor mentioned that Thoreau challenges us to living an overtly bloated life, I would say that it’s more difficult than it looks and that’s because many people are tied down and confined to the actions of others.

I appreciated your comment. While reading “Walden”, I could tell it was an old work based on the style of writing, but I was shocked by how much it resonated with our current society. I can only imagine how much simpler life was back then and now we have completely super sized that lifestyle. We added cars, modern technology and increased our population by billions. Thoreau shares his experience of living in Walden pond for two years, and how liberating the experience was. I see you have a few critiques on transcendentalists, and I too share some of the same critiques.
 <br><br>


 You are right, becoming a full-blown transcendentalist and living out in the woods disconnected from the world is mostly only for one’s own benefit. It would limit someone from being politically active and attempting to dismantle the capitalist society that enables consumerism. But I don’t think Thoreau’s purpose was to encourage his readers to follow his experiment. I think he was merely trying to demonstrate the enlightenment, freedom and happiness that comes from simplifying one’s life. If he was able to go completely off the grid for two years, grow food and still find immense happiness and fulfillment, then the average American will surely find more fulfillment if they stop consuming useless crap. Moreover, individual choice is still important even if it does not make a huge impact. Corporations are hugely responsible for climate change, but they only produce to meet our demands of goods. If we stop buying, they stop producing. Placing all the blame on corporations lets the individual consume whatever they want whenever they want. We have to take responsibility for our carbon obsessed lifestyles, and not merely put blame on corporations.

 thank you for your response, :)

I do agree on your comment, that Thoreau did not tell humans to disappear and live in nature. But rather, the foundational principles that he explains based on his experience in the wilderness is what is essential to his “transcendentalism.” Foundational principles of transcendentalism emphasize individualist pursuit of self fulfillment, such as “escapism,” which does not necessarily have to mean literally leaving society, but rather escaping material conditions that we as a collective are presented it in order to reach such enlightenment, freedom, and happiness. I believe Americans can find great fulfillment in adopting minimalism, but materially, I think it serves no purpose than to those who practice it, and unfortunately, we don’t exist outside of others presence. What I believe is that though we do deserve happiness, enlightenment, and freedom, we also owe this to others. 
 <br><br>

Corporations (capitalism) do not necessarily function on a scale of supply and demand; rather they function through the emphasis of wage accumulation. Other characteristics of capitalism include private property, wage labor, and competitive markets. With this being said, (competitive) markets would nonetheless still exist. For example, let’s say that  mostly everyone in the world no longer consumes beef and that there is only one or two beef corporations left in the world; they would nonetheless have their own access to their production, and no regulation, as a capitalist market intends to achieve wage accumulation. This can be done at the expense of the workers, or the third world as we commonly see today. We can shut industries down with trends, such how the milk industry has been- , but nonetheless with the persistence of capitalism, wage accumulation will be sought in other ways, such as through the almond milk, soy milk industry etc. will be exhausted wherever it can be. Yes we can all switch to a plant based diet (a diet I am currently on), but it does not dismiss the fact that overseas labour is exploited . This may be slightly better for the environment, can it still exploit the land through unregulated practices and exploitation of the third world (capitalist economy= profit>sustainability).We cannot escape capitalism if we live inside of it. 
 <br><br>

I do also agree that we should stop engaging in carbon consuming habits and useless purchases. But like the minimalist Joshua said, we (minimalists) are still consumers, but not compulsive consumers. Minimalists still function within a capitalist economy and limitations become evident. For example, we look at nordic countries  who have adopted a plenitude economy (minimalist based). People in such nordic countries can be described to live as ‘minimalists,’ way less consumers than Americans. Scandinavian countries seem appealing to many minimalists because of this plenitude economy, but the flaw is seen when these laborious demands are shifted overseas; maybe less furniture production, but it’s still there exploiting the third world. A plenitude economy may not be environmentally sustainable in ALL parts of the world, the professor mentioned that Minimalism is a first world solution to a first world problem; first world problems have definitely created problems in the third world. What I’m trying to say is that a capitalist market is a capitalist market and it’s meant to function the way it does. I’m sure the minimalists had on shirts made in sweatshops that emit tons of pollution, or if let’s say they didn’t, those shirts were still made in a factory somewhere that does emit pollution. Sustainability is not a goal of corporations, just profit accumulation. Not only because these owners can be thought at greedy, but because capitalism objectively functions in that way.

Back in junior year in high school. I had the pleasure to study the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, who are both prominent figures of the idea of Transcendentalism. Their ideas had inspired me in some degree and encouraged me to embrace nature to seek peace more. I had also started reading other nature-centered literature. In addition, I had the honor to physically visit Walden Pond during my school trip. Glazing upon the shore, autumn leaves shed on the ground paved a trail of gold. The sound of our feet gently stomping on the orange carpet made pleasing crunchy sounds while we took a walk on the trail. But there was not much elsewhere to behold upon. Glancing at the whole view, the scenery of the water and the woods appear rather bland, ordinary. It would not really make any tourist attraction if it wasn’t the place where the great poet dwelled for years. However, the place does offer me a rare sense of peace. Sitting on a bench close to the shore, I felt like I could stare into the opposite shore for the whole cloudy afternoon, pondering about nothing except the mere view in front of me. Now as I look back at it, I think maybe it's unattractiveness and ordinariness was the reason that drew Henry David Thoreau here. This place had no fancy scenery or geological wander, but rather is a spot that can be found on every other corner of the planet. It is MINIMAL. It is comprised of the minimal of everything: minimal human intervention and minimal nature. Its simplicity that frees me from the thoughts and pursuits of worldly things. Whenever I go into nature, I was always reminded one of Thoreau’s famous quotes “I went to the woods because I wanted to live deliberately”. I believe we are so caught up with the materialistic matters nowadays and we lose the “liberty” to ourselves, we became the slaves of the things and fame we are pursuing. Another famous quote by Thoreau goes by “Our lives are frittered away by details, simplify, simplify…” preaches to the need to reduce the complexity in our lives too.

I believe Thoreau was already providing a solution to the future without even knowing it with our current environmental and economic state. Specifically, he adheres to the side of consumerism and lifestyle it dictates upon Americans and first-world countries with its consequences on the environment. Just as Ken had urged us to take action with his five suggestions, Thoreau’s challenge to his readers highlighted in “Walden” reflects a significant need to reform our way of living. While modern society may view Thoreau’s experience of life at Walden Pond as radical or completely unfamiliar, his call to action to disregard meaning in materialism and luxuries provide the ultimate solution needed for us as consumers to take action against climate change. Specifically, with our diets, purchasing of clothes, and desires of a large house size, Thoreau tackles all these “issues” in taking on a vegetarian diet, limiting his clothes worn, and living in a smaller house. These are all suggestions Ken and climate researchers have urged us to take on in order to put an end to contributing factors of climate change with methane release from animals in food production or factories supporting these industries and much more. 
 <br><br>


The inability to discipline ourselves or change our self-destructive habits is pointed out by Thoreau, who states “Men chose a common mode of living because they preferred it to any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left.” For those like me who come from suburban areas, I understand how it may be difficult to longer place emphasis in such aspects that subtle influence our decisions and lifestyle; however, such recognition must be met with immediate and effective action in order to push forward efforts against the only increasing progression of released carbon emissions. Thoreau highlights the lifestyle we are chained to in bondage without realizing the negative impacts it has, and as we know it now, those impacts are on our environment itself. Yet ignorance or denial only restricts improvement rather than put it into effect.
  <br><br>
Thoreau's claims echo centuries later to us in the present day in acknowledgement of the toxic lifestyles we have to those unaware, giving the answer to each individual the action they can take themselves.

I agree with your comment about how his message still is equally representative of the society we’re in now, almost 200 years later than his time. The parallels between his critiques of people’s lifestyles and Ken’s suggestions on how to change our lifestyles to reduce our impact on the environment are very apparent. I think it’s interesting to see how these issues have been made aware by people for such a long time and yet we continue our behavior. It reminded me of Ken discussing how people have known and felt the effects of fossil fuels since the 70s and yet we still continue, and increase, our usage of fossil fuels. It is disheartening as these issues have been made aware yet people don’t take serious action, making “Knowledge is power” a less true statement. 
  <br><br>
Thoreau recognized people’s overconsumption and that people worked to fulfill a need to own more things, creating unhappiness. This was only the root of consumerism and the problem has only grown exponentially since then. He really attacked a problem that is still so relevant. People are overworked and have turned into machines, feeding into the idea that we need all this stuff, instead of focusing on being happy. His quote “The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation” is just as relevant now since the vast majority of Americans live a lifestyle consisting of work and trying to either survive, or have more stuff. People no longer know how to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. I think that is so important to not get caught up in the struggles of everyday life and remind ourselves of what is truly important. I think this reading is incredibly relevant as it highlights how the root issues of overconsumption and work have become ingrained in American lifestyle and it needs to be changed, for both the bettering of humanity and the environment.

<br><hr>
I agree with this comment for the most part. The only part I disagree with is that I believe Thoreau knew what he was doing when he suggested this style of living. Yes is did take time for this to become well received, but he did want to convey the benefits of these actions for people and the environment. He knew that people are very materialistic and he wanted to change the way people thought and the culture of people. He wanted to help people believe in a monist lifestyle, one where the good life was composed of the simple things in life. Such things consisted of eating and just being involved in nature as he wanted people to see the world as something to be worshipped. Thoreau thought one way and maybe the only way to happiness was through the simple life. He also tried to make people see the negative effects of buying materials such as with conveying that the fashion industry was bad and also saying buying locally was better since it saves the environment and it keeps more money in the economy. Many of the things that Thoreau did back then are now perceived as positive for the environment such with eating vegetarian and also living in a small house, and he did that purposefully. I do agree with you on the fact that changing from our materialistic and carnivorous culture to ones of minimalism and vegetarianism will be very difficult. I was raised in a suburb and my parents are big advocates of saving the environment, but they are not well informed on how to do so, and it may be too late for them to change as I have tried to convince them to eat less meat and buy less. I was with them for Thanksgiving break and they didn’t want to listen to me when I said our carbon footprint is very large as they did not want to accept they were causing so much damage to the environment. But I do believe that we can slowly shift our culture in the right path as these things are very beneficial not only to the planet, but also people.

"Walden" is one of the most famous productions written by Henry David Thoreau. It can be seen as a kind of diary when he lived alone in the forest. He supposed the self-sufficient life and explained a lot of benefits and advantages of living in this kind of style. 

  <br><br>

To be honest, I can only go along with some parts of ideas said by Thoreau. I agree with the words spoken by him, which pointed out there are more and more people in modern society are not live for themselves, but live for some substance. It is definitely true in my life. In my home country- China- more and more young people are fighting for buying one house in a modern city- Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The price of one home is so high that most people cannot afford it. Most people need to spend their whole life to make money until they retire. However, to consider more deeply, is this house worth people to do that? People spend their most ideal time to fight for substance and can only enjoy these things until they are old, which means that their health is not as good as their teenager's time and the happiness of traveling or living in a better house may not achieve the level when they are young. House may worth people to do this from my perspective; however, there are a considerable amount of people spending their money to buy a lot of luxury, which they cannot afford it actually. The reason they want to buy it is just that they realize their friend has it, so they also want to have it. This kind of lifestyle is abnormal and should be changed. 
  <br><br>


However, this does not mean that I agree with the lifestyle of Thoreau. People have their own right to decide what kind of life they want. For me, I do not want to live just like Thoreau. Since I am an economics major, I will consider the opportunity cost of doing a thing. Opportunity cost not only limited in money but also includes the time you need to spend on finishing this thing. If you spend time building a house by yourself, it is indeed much cheaper than buying your own home in the city. However, have you considered how much time you need to spend on this thing? How much money can you get during the time you spending on building a house by yourself? To be honest, people who do not need to worry about whether they will starve in the future can consider building a house by themselves. Just like Maslow's hierarchy of needs said, people need to first achieve their basic needs, like foods, and then finally meet the needs of self-actualization. Nevertheless, there are so many people in the world who are now suffering from basic needs. Telling them not to consider making money and stop thinking about substance is ridiculous and unrealistic.

 I found your comment really intriguing, especially since it outlined a few of my first thoughts on "Walden". I too believe that people build/live a life based on substance. Obviously, one's relation to wealth, materialism, and way of life is extremely relative based on a number of factors which Ken brought up. This and your third paragraph made me think about a video I watched recently on youtube. The video is titled "17 Year Old Builds Tiny House For Only £6,000!". This video highlights a house that I see as the prime example what It would be like to live the minimalist lifestyle Thoreau describes. The house has a bed, a place to make food and a place to use the bathroom. However, the house also has a number of luxuries, including a flatscreen TV with a swivel, a nice refrigerator and located in a nice part of England on a large piece of property. The kind of opportunity found in this video is extremely rare and living this kind of life style is not economically and socially feasible for a young adult like myself. 

  <br><br>

I for one would love to live in this kind of house, even if it meant building it with my hands. I would take out a loan right now If I knew I could build a house using scrap material and not be living in the middle of nowhere. The boy in the video is living on land owned by his grand father, and not to mention the boy is an aspiring carpenter himself. This boy is a product of his own script which was laid out for him far before he was born. He is only able to live this lifestyle and still have human connection under reasonable circumstances because of his grandfather owning the land. lets take my life for example. I nor nobody I am related too owns undeveloped land in a place where I can maintain real interpersonal experiences with people know. If I wanted to buy land in Santa Barbara, It would cost at least 250,000 per acre which will continue to rise in this real estate market. 

  <br><br>

Sadly, though this lifestyle is very intriguing, it is just finically possible for vast majority of young individuals in places like California. However, on the same youtube channel, I started to see more videos featuring people finding creative and modern ways to live with a semi-bare minimum amount of material items in houses that were made out shipping containers, old buses and even parking spots. These are people who are attaining the first level of the hierarchy of needs. Though these homes actually look appealing, location will always be the issue.


<br><hr>
I definitely agree with your opinion on how unrealistic Thoreau's lifestyle is for the majority of people. It would take a tremendous amount of dedication and sacrifice in order to fully live in a self-made cabin by yourself and be truly happy, without even considering how one would find adequate food and water. Furthermore, how would they contact friends and family? Wouldn't it be selfish to just go out into the forest and leave behind everyone who's cared for you and loved you, only to live more "simply"? 

  <br><br>

That being said, I think Thoreau's message isn't merely an advocating for his readers to adopt his lifestyle. He argues for a rethinking of how society values things, more specifically the excess of things. For Thoreau, luxury and satisfaction isn't having the newest things, or the most expensive things, or the most fashionable. He finds meaning in producing his own livelihood, and the satisfaction he gets from making a small profit by growing produce and cutting expenses is much more whole than anything materialistic. In this regard, modern society can clearly learn something from a simpler lifestyle.

<br><hr>



I agree with you that people have their right to decide how to live. Walden strongly criticizes materialistic lifestyles and large homes, but some people like having large homes. However, I think Walden is more of a guide for how to be poor when you are rich, it is encouraging voluntary minimalism.
  <br><br>


Also,  you could be making money in the time you use to build the house, but are you happy in that time? I think we have to not just consider money but also happiness as wealth, like a plenitude economy. 

  <br><br>


I think the most important thing Walden teaches us is that there are other lifestyles that may lead to happiness besides the consumerist one, and that we should reevaluate our idea of a good life, since it may not even be our own. It might just be the idea that our culture teaches us and that we have taken as the only way for granted.

  <br><br>

I don't like how he portrays his lifestyle as so revolutionary. The majority of people are living in those conditions. For instance, he bought his "tiny one person house" from an Irish family. I think he has to show it as cool and novel to appeal to rich people though.

<br><hr>
As a person who have also studied economics, I agree with your opinion. The basic idea that Thoreau try to express in the passage is people should live in a life style as simple as possible. True, living in the the way that Thoreau provides would definitely be environmental-friendly and reduce the level of pollution. However, it is unrealistic and impossible. In economics, people will have needs and wants. Needs means the basic necessities like food and shelter for people and wants are the desire of people. It is the unlimited wants of people and limited resources that cause the problem of scarcity. Thoreau suggests that we should abandon all our “wants” and only live with “needs”. Unfortunately, this objective is impossible to achieve by us, the most rapacious species on earth. I believe that every person will more or less have desire or lust. Also, as our modern technology has given us so many benefits and convenience, do you really think that people are willing to give up all these prosperity and have a life two thousands or even more anciently? I’m afraid the answer will be NO.
  <br><br>


Although it seems impossible to live like what Thoreau has shown, it is plausible and necessary to restrains and limits our wants. Our infinite desire is the major cause of excess production. We are producing every thing far more than we needed. For instance, about one-third or even more food has been wasted on our tables simply because we want more but we cannot digest them. Also, like luxuries and fancy clothes, the reason we buy them is not because we really need they, but it is because the comparing phenomenon and our self desire. I’m not trying to say that people shouldn’t buy them. It is definitely true that people are free to choose the living style they want if they have the ability to do so. But stand in the position of the entire humanity and earth, which include everyone, we should reduce our wants and eliminate wastes as more as possible. Instead of living in a huge mansion that require large amount of time and energy to maintain its clean and making an amount of food that cannot be finished everyday, isn’t it better and more convenient to live in a regular house? If we all can control our wants and prevent wastage and excess usage, I believe our planet and environment will automatically and eventually become better.

As I read this book, I saw how Thoreau realized the importance of simplifying our way of life, while we are still trapped in a materialized way of life. We are obsessed with fast fashion clothes, luxury decoration, and fancy cars. In our minds, those things can symbolize our "success." However, when we waste and demand those things, it exploits our natural resources and creates a climate crisis. But Thoreau is different since he managed to live with a minimum. He has only a few clothes and lives in a house he built and grows vegetables every day. His life is self-sufficiency. Thoreau tried to downplay the role of materialism in his life. He found that his life could still be full without them. From my perspective, material things are not the determinant of happiness. It will only bring temporary happiness, will soon disappear, leaving us empty. It doesn't even make us happier most of the time. Professor Ken says that “what this new generation needs to do is take up through this challenge and rewrite and reconsider the script.” Although it seems that Thoreau’s simplified life is impossible in our 21st century, there are still some people who try to live as simply as they can. For example, in China, a girl called Ziqi Li has become one of the most successful internet celebrities by sharing her rural lifestyle in videos. With 21.05 million followers on Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo and 7.46 million subscribers on YouTube, she has made videos that appeal to netizens around the world. Just like Thoreau did, she grows vegetables and raises cattle and crops. It is impossible to live without high technologies, but we can choose a more simple way to live.

I have to admit that the central idea of Walden is quite appealing to me in general senses. However, with a second thought, I don’t agree with him entirely. Humans will now be vegetarians eventually, as thousands of years have passed and humans remain still  meat-eaters for some reason. I mean hunting for meat is far more difficult than collecting crops right? But we are still meat-eaters, and therefore it is unrealistic to be vegetarian as a whole species. The idea of harvesting what you plant yourself is a brilliant but still unrealistic idea. In fact, the central idea of his proposal is to return to the base of human needs. He judges the outcome, which is quite unfair. I mean, when we view the process of human improvement, we will find out that the development into globalization is inevitable. One may stand at this developed point and complain about the genuinity and simplicity we have lost, but when we first adopt something, it is indeed an improvement and thus the improvement is inevitable. Additionally, returning to these so-called simple lives is hard. As an American, it is hard to imagine how Saudi Arabian deal with “growing crops” and populated places like India and China deal with insufficient places. From my perspective, growing everything one needs may result in inefficiency compared to how farmers grow sufficient for a city. We reach efficiency nowadays economically, and we need not to cry over the carbon emission spent because it is worthy when considering starvation. It is hard to believe the idea of simple life and small communities remain “plausible” to the author, as it was never a new idea. As early as 5 thousand years ago, Chinese do think that way and it is never realistic. Additionally, I really don’t appreciate the author’s own experiment as a valuable or convincing material. As the only person or the minority doing this so-called “simplified” life, the author can surely compensate himself by selling home-grown crops and something else etc. However, if everyone gets the idea of home-grow, the market of crops will shrink tremendously, and how can you indeed make up for the daily expenses as the major income of him is through selling vegetables. Well, I am pretty harsh towards the passage, as it is an antiquated and stupid view and will be unsustainable both then and now. From this point of view, the author is no wiser than Robert Owen and Saint-Simon (recall his miserable experience of killing himself with a gun r.i.p).

It is interesting to know that our materialistic values for more lavish things predated the 1920s or even industrial America, and that all the lifestyle changes were still needed back in antebellum America. Still, I think that the most important thing about Thorau is the one massive mistake that he made in his mission to simplify which was him completely turning his back on society as a whole while he went off to ponder life out by Walden lake. The conclusions that he came to were insightful, rather than dealing with the conditions of the poor of the country (say like the Irish family who he got the cabin from) which only got way worse as industrialization would soon magnify the wealth inequality and horrid living conditions of the poor, especially in cities. What especially worries me is that it seems the biggest idea that Thoreau is known for is the “back to nature” lifestyle, I believe has generally actually been harmful. A good example is the real story of Into the Wild where a college grad named Chris McCandless completely disappears to go run off and live in nature and wander around the country (presumably because he found more meaning in that than his real life). The problem with that (other than it led to him passing away from starvation in Alaska) is it shows that the legacy of transcendentalism has become “run away from society into nature” rather than actually try to use that calling to instead trying to fix that society and integrate more of the natural world into it, which would make us happier as a civilization.

When I was reading Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” I finds that the insight of the author is so suitable for the society now. One term he mentioned is the consumerism and the negative impacts on the environment. He also mentioned that nowadays people has unlimited desires about the luxuries. Actually, we have more desires than what we need. Luxuries cannot make people feel happy but people just want that. As my own perspective, we should think about more about the planet we live. We should use more reusable clothes and stuff. We should try to reduce our luxury.

Hands down I completely agree with you, society is too focused on the trends, and not focused on the well being of the planet, the new generation thinks that saving the planet is trendy, which is good, but they do not really know the first steps to take or just believe that them telling others is enough. Having a busy economy is good but not at the expense of the earth we live on. Some people are too worried about dirtying their white shoes, but what they do not know is that if the earth is heating up the way it is, droughts will continue in California and then you’ll have to worry about all the dust so clean white shoes would be impossible. That was supposed to come out a lot better but it is a youtube comment and you know how those things go. Consumerism has been talked a lot about in a multitude of media. In fact “The Road” by Cormac McCarthy has underlying themes of what consumerism does to the individual, by setting it in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. People have this hunger, that nothing can satisfy and they only end up anting more and more. Sadly that is the road our world is heading down if we do not change the culture.


<br><hr>
To expand further on your comment, I would like to bring about the point that many people only want the best luxuries because of the competitive atmosphere that has been brought about in today’s society. Everyone is in the mindset of only wanting the best clothes, shoes, houses, etc. that pushes people to buy unnecessary things only for the clout that comes with it. This is an extremely wasteful mindset, as things come and go faster and with the trends of society. Not only that, people only find happiness utility from new items for so long in order to fill a void but soon the newness wears off and they feel the need to discard the item for something more favorable. This rather constant cycle of wanting to fill one’s life with excess commodities to see more well of than others is a dangerous one, especially for the well-being of our planet. We as a society need to do better at trying to stop this trend before it is too late. Although the economy may favor a more wasteful mindset as it would allow more of their commodities to be bought, we have to be able to find a good in-between that would not hurt our planet as much as we’re doing in this current day and age.

This reading was interesting in that someone was this committed to simple living.  While reading this, it made sense to me that someone would want to live their life with just the things that you need to live your life.  It is not necessary to live in a big house if a small one is enough for you to live.  Likewise, you do not need many pieces of furniture if you can live comfortably with a few pieces.  
  <br><br>
Thoreau’s view of life is that you just need the necessities in order to enjoy life.  
  <br><br>
Thoreau does make a point in saying that you do not have the freedom to choose what you do with your life because you are born into a certain role that you are expected to maintain.  In the case of the farmers who were born on their farm, they have to spend their lives growing food and selling their products in order to maintain their lifestyle.  Changing occupations would be difficult because that would mean having to leave the stable source of income you have been relying on in the hopes that you will be just as successful in your new chosen occupation.

I believe that Thoreau’s ideas fit well with the idea of minimalism that is becoming popular today.  Because people are no longer able to afford more lavish lifestyles (big houses, more things), they decide on their lifestyle based on what they determine to be necessary for them to live a fulfilling life.  While the previous generation may expect their children to be successful in whatever career path they choose and buy big houses/expensive things, it is more likely that the children will just buy whatever they need, not everything they want.
  <br><br>
Having this kind of mindset is great for slowing climate change because if people want less, there will be less emissions created from the processes of producing things.  Furthermore, as the younger generation, who is more open to these kinds of ideas, takes charge of what goes on in the world, it will be easier to transition into a world that is more environmentally friendly.

Though it was written in the 19th century, Thoreau’s book is more meaningful in this century than ever before. Reading it was hard to follow sometimes, like other people have said, I was finding myself reading bits over again to understand somewhat what he was trying to say. Yet, one of the things I did hold onto was his seemingly bitter attitude towards fashion and consumerism. I agree with what you said that people have unlimited wants, in addition to the idea that Thoreau presents of this endless cycle of a man who works to buy riches that (sometimes) get stolen. It’s this endless process of working to get to the top to buy whatever, just like the wealthy guys present in the Minimalism movie. I found it interesting that Ken mentioned the Dalai Lama when assigning this reading. Just last quarter I read Ethics for the New Millennium by the Dalai Lama (1999), in which he outlines and explores ways we can better improve ourselves for a fulfilling life. One thing he mentioned was to be happy and content with what one has. Because we could want a million things, we’re constantly disappointed or worked over something we cannot have. If we were simply happy with whatever we had, there wouldn’t be an opportunity to be let down at what we can’t get.

Agreed. I think the biggest take away from Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" is the importance of taking a step back and really putting into perspective the degree to which we "live the life scripted to us." In today's society we are taught that we need a whole bunch of excess materialistic items to make us "happy" or prove our status. Sadly, and quite inevitably, each new generation grows up in a society that dictates the high-standards of living to be the goal and consequently has us falling into the trap. Thoreau's challenge to us as readers in the twenty-first century serves as a point of reflection in which we can analyze our lavish consumption habits and instead trade them for a life that focuses on the mere necessities of life.


<br><hr>
I agree that "Walden" is relevant today. I think that a lot of our generation will soon face the harsh reality of not being able to live at the same level of luxury as our parents. This in turn will lead to people feeling inadequate and seeking more things in their lives. I am hopeful that will force people to confront the reality that things will never fill a void of unhappiness and and to naturally seek a simplistic lifestyle. I think the transition will be difficult seeing as how our generation has been exposed to the most media in human history through the internet and proliferation of smart devices and that this media plays a huge role in forming our expectations of the world and ourselves. We've grown up with entertainment that glorifies wealth and all of us envy luxurious lifestyles. I think that any happiness that depends on external luxuries (aside from basic necessities) will never be true happiness.
<br><hr>
I agree that we have way more desires than what we actually need. I think people still idolize Henry David Thoreau because he was able to do what many people weren't able to do and abandon all of his material possessions and live the life of the land. While the background of Thoreau coming from a rich family and the fact that many people do not have the privilege he has to just throw everything away is problematic his strong ideals still resonate with many people's inner beliefs to live a life cut off from the consumerist life. I probably cannot think of a single person that lives their lives to the lowest in terms of what they need. Luxuries surround almost everyone to the point that we convince ourselves that we need them, Thoreau's beliefs are what we should aim to better ourselves to reduce our consumption of goods and reduce our carbon footprints.

<br><hr>
I agree with your statement that the author's argument is suitable for today's society. I've had many conversation's with close friends about the purpose of learning all this knowledge and going into thousands of dollars of debt with the aim of becoming rich and showing off to all our friends and families. However the idea of simplicity and living a simple life like Thoreau had not even remotely crossed my mind. I've been following this script my whole life and I can't possibly think to deviate from this script. These luxuries are seen as necessities and a desire to climb to social ladder has been so far ingrained in me that I believe I will be stuck in the cycle forever. A cycle that isn't sustainable for this Earth. It was fascinating to learn that this man was happy and content with such little amount of things. I would see this man as a bum or lazy however he is happier then I would ever be. I was fascinating to see a completely different view of life, a life that is heavily scorned by the average person in society. This mind set of mine is what led to a crumbling planet and unfortunately I cannot see a way out of this mindset. However, I hope that I may be able to break this desire and live a more sustainable and happier life.


<br><hr>
I agree with your opinion. While consumption means acquiring and using goods and services to meet one's needs, the idea of consumerism in Walden is the particular relationship to consumption in which we seek to meet our emotional and social needs through shopping, and we define and demonstrate our self-worth through the stuff we own. But indeed, our self-worth isn't based on the stuff we own. Currently, businesses like the fashion industry or luxury industry are trying to get people focused on what they define as "trends" or "style". However, many people who payed for them didn't really know if they really need that stuff. As for me, Walden's life in his cabin is voluntarily simple. It's not about what he owns, but the things that could make him happy simply aren't things. We all desire for more things, if they don't come with a cost. But buying things like luxuries are costing our environment too much for us to afford, and I believe this is why we need to use more reusable clothes as you said.

It is amazing to think about how Thoreau realized the importance of a simplified lifestyle while we, modern generations, are still trapped in a materialized lifestyle. We are obsessed with fast fashions, Mcmansions, cars that are told to symbolize our “success”. This lifestyle has led us to exploiting natural resources and causing climate crisis. Then we look back to Thoreau and how he managed to live a minimized life. He only has a few clothes because it is sufficient for him to own this much. In addition to clothing, Thoreau minimized the role of all signs of materialism in his life. He discovered that his life could still be fulfilling without those stuff. Stuff is not the determinant of our happiness. It cannot even make us happier most of the time. It only brings joy in the short run, which can quickly vanish and leave us empty inside. If we dig deeper, we would find that we are advertised to become obsessed with materialism. Those ads keep telling us that only stuff can manifest how successful we are, and those ads are made by enterprises. It seems that everyone has fell into a trap designed by these companies for centuries. It is time to wake up now.

I found this comment to be very interesting because I hadn’t thought about the first chapter from Walden in this way. Tang brings up how amazing it is that Thoreau “...realized the importance of a simplified lifestyle while we, modern generations, are still trapped in a materialized lifestyle.” It is telling that the precedent for a minimalist lifestyle was being set almost two hundred years ago. Therefore, it is not as if the knowledge of the benefits of this way of living hasn’t been around. It has been around, and for quite a long time. Thoreau’s journey to Walden is truly inspiring. He decided that he didn’t care to be in a constant circuit of obsession with stuff, so he simply cut himself off from the material world completely. He had very few clothes, he built a very small house, and he lived off the land. He conducted this experiment for a whole 26 months, which is crazy for me to think about. Personally, I don’t think this would have worked for me, but his experiment also shows that maybe we can look to find a medium between Walden and America today. If this happens, it might improve the lives of Americans vastly (as Thoreau believes), but it would also help to reduce climate change--a process that needs to be set in motion right now.


<br><hr>
I agree advertisement along with fast fashion has gotten in the way of what is able to actually make us happy. Thoreau's story seems like one of a kind in 1854. Even back then he notices how farmers are chained to their farms like prisoners. Although Thoreau was doubted by locals he was ablate build himself a happy lifestyle without excess materials. Reading that made me reflect on my own situation and I came to the conclusion I could only live that type of lifestyle unless it was necessary. However, in the current state of our planet it does seem like it is. Everyone including myself are all victims to wanting more and more luxuries. Those items likely bring short term happiness but don't solve the deep rooted unfulfillment we all face in life. Those items also just add to the destruction of our Earth. However, I feel if Thoreau was around in modern times he would also struggle due to the big influence advertisements have along with peer pressure to conform. Reading "Walden" made me wonder how different our lives would be if more people like Thoreau shaped the world. Would our world be the same if people followed behind his trends instead? Additionally can we really reverse and make the 7.5 billion change to a simple lifestyle?

Henry David Thoreau's story Walden was a good review of the idea of living simple. I really like Ken's review of the story although I did not like how long Walden the actual story was. This reading was a trip back to memory lane because I read it in AP Lit in high school and when I first read it I was inspired by the idea of changing my lifestyle. I tried to take up being a vegetarian and try and minimize my goods but in reality it was harder than I thought. 

<br><br>
I think that it is true that Thoreau is right in the idea that we can live off of nature but it would be a big shift from how the world is living now. Having more stuff does not make anyone more happy, I think that it does the opposite. I want to live in a world that recycling is everywhere, only a few piece of clothes, and being vegan.

At first read I also was inspired by the simple lifestyle that Walden introduces. I thought that the structure of a sustainable life in the woods was inspiring and it made me more keen on the idea of doing our own part in helping the environment, although I also must say I myself would not be one to take such a drastic leap and live in the woods by myself. I also cannot completely relate on the idea of the minimalist life —however I completely support this notion and commend you for only needing a few pieces of clothes to be happy! 
<br><br>
I also think it is interesting that people have been trying to escape the daily lifestyle of the average person in society for over 100 years now. It is funny to me because I often associate “getting away” as a technology break, but in his time technology was nothing compared to what it is today and I wonder if all and every society throughout history had norms that people felt the need to stray from.

The ideas behind Walden indicate how many of today’s problems are not entirely new. Many people, such as Thoreau, have long been aware of humanity’s tendency to resist against a lifestyle of minimalism even though it could be beneficial. Through his experience living in a cabin with no luxuries, he analyzed how people’s attachments to “luxury” inhibit them from experiencing many aspects of the world. Thoreau’s ideas today could match with the trend of minimalism, in which people value simplicity in areas such as fashion instead of extreme excess. Trends such as thrifting match the idea that we should "beware of all enterprises that require new clothes."
 <br><br>

I do, however, find issue with much of the ideology behind Walden. Thoreau treats his life in the forest as an experiment to deepen his understanding of certain ideologies. In reality, many people in the world are impoverished and have no choice but to live without luxury. By implying that his way of life in the cabin is so revolutionary and unique, we are able to ignore the fact that this way of life is already lived by many. I probably would have appreciated the article a lot more if Thoreau analyzed the lives of families who do live without luxury or maybe even lived with them for a bit. These families aren’t able to do experiments for fun, and I feel that Thoreau maybe should’ve taken this into account.

Prior to reading your comment, I did not take into consideration the fact that many people are unable to experiment with living in such simplistic conditions due to the fact that they are living in poverty.  However, I am glad I did come across your comment because it truly made me realize that there is another side to Thoreau's minimalism argument.  Because we are blind to the fact that millions of people are living unsuitable lifestyles and have very poor living conditions, we only see this way of life as a spectacle to experiment with.  It is quite ironic that humanity has been aware of the tendency to resist overly luxurious lifestyles and resort to minimalistic conditions, yet there are millions of people that long for a lifestyle that is met with "luxurious" commodities such as a large house or different options of clothing.  You would think that because we spend our lives working hard to live a comfortable life, we would be able to have the liberty to buy whatever we want and live in whatever conditions suit us best.  I feel it is probably the biggest error in Thoreau's argument that he does not take into account the families that are living in impoverished conditions.  Although Thoreau's minimalism argument has great ideological benefits, it nevertheless has some flaws as it does not consider those who do not have the choice to experiment with living in extreme minimalistic conditions.


<br><hr>
I think that this is a very insightful comment as you make very good points. There are a lot of similarities between Thoreau's ideas and what people do in today's society to keep things minimal. People buy tiny homes and only have so many clothes or they chose to thrift clothes instead of going out and buying new ones. I am sure that to live a minimalistic lifestyle isn't the main reason people choose to thrift as it has become more of a trend than anything, but still it has helped the environment nonetheless. The idea of thrifting almost proves how as a society we could really make a change by turning something positive into a trend. If youth sees famous or a mass amount of people doing something and they perceive it as trendy and cool, they most likely will start doing it too. Anyway I really thought that the second part of your response was really something to ponder over and would have been interesting to be able to have asked Thoreau about his feelings towards this. He lived a life that a moderate portion of the world lives today but the thing is he had a choice and these people don't. To them, this isn't something they're trying out to prove to the world or write an essay about what they discovered. It's a life that they most likely don't want to be living and would do anything to have a choice about it.

I enjoy how you brought up the issues of the ideology behind Walden. While I was fascinated to read how, as you mentioned, peoples attachments to material luxuries inhibit them from experiencing the world, I do agree that Thoreau should have instead analyzed the lives of societies whose lifestyles are not based on experiments. Then again, those same problems are still happening. Minimalism got popular in recent years because majority of people that come from different forms of privilege are profiting off the lifestyles of many low-income minorities. Yet, only the privileged people are credited for experimenting with their lifestyle rather than crediting the people who have no choice but to live that way.  However, I was intrigued to read that Thoreau, even in those times, lived similarly to that in which a modern day minimalist would. It fascinated me to learn how he practically went vegetarian/vegan during his time at the cabin and how much that was able to save him in costs. It was quite interesting to see how very little could take him in just one year (and how the price could have dropped in year two given that he didn't have to include expenses of building the cabin). I feel that, though we don't have to go as extreme as he did, as a society, we (as in the American society) could take many of his concepts and ideas and apply them to our lives, we could turn them from an experiment to helping the environment be more sustainable with much less.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. Although Thoreau introduced the basis of minimalism and revealed to us the benefits of a simplified lifestyle, I do believe that it can't apply to everyone. Maybe back then when consumerism was not at its peak, he tried to indulge people to not pursue a luxurious life, but rather to go back to our ancestor's natural way of living. In such a way, he discovered the strength of the tie between a man and  a materialistic life. However, nowadays we live in a completely different society, where you can't afford to experiment with life as easily. I do think that focusing your life and education to achieve a materialistic world is not the answer, rather to be able learn and navigate the world. Personally, education is very important to me; in the United States the lowest level of education required is high school. On average, you will need a degree to have a decent life and pay your bills, etc.

While reading Walden, I honestly found myself getting bored. I felt as though he droned on for far too long about building his house and about the various expenses that went into it. I think that a lot of the points that he made could’ve been confined into a much shorter piece while still getting across the same points. Even with all of this being said, there were quite a few golden nuggets of truth that greatly resonated with me. One of these tackles the conflict of neverending human wants with this quote: “When a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what does he want next? Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and richer food, larger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothing, more numerous, incessant, and hotter fires, and the like.” He correctly describes the issue of human desire. Where do we draw the line as we indulge in materialism? In other words, when do we stop seeking more material goods after we have already begun buying them? Another point that Walden made that stuck with me regarded the comparison of cheap clothes in excess versus the maintenance of fewer, quality items of clothing. He stated  that “our outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are our epidermis, or false skin, which partakes not of our life, and may be stripped off here and there without fatal injury; our thicker garments, constantly worn, are our cellular integument, or cortex; but our shirts are our liber, or true bark, which cannot be removed without girdling and so destroying the man.” I found this anatomical juxtaposition to be simultaneously artful and revealing about human indulgence in fast fashion. It is so fundamental in the capitalist mindset of Americans to buy clothing in excess, being a measure of status, when that excess of clothing is often lacking greatly in quality. Walden alternatively suggests in this comparison of the outer layer of the skin to the outer layer of the brain that there is far more value in the accumulation of a few, quality items that will last longer and provide better use.

I agree with you about how boring and difficult this text was to read because so many minor details were being discussed upon, and I kept waiting for him to get on with the main idea at some point. Even though I understand it's an older text, the words also were elevated seemingly for no reason other than to drag on a single sentence and make a simple statement more long winded than it needed to be. I did like the same quote that you referenced in your comment about human desire and the insatiable craving we have to gain more than what we have regardless of whether it truly makes us happy in the long run. The line between occasional indulgence and full-on worship of materialism has eroded a long time ago with the advent of consumer culture enforced by large-scale advertising everywhere you go and the help of tools like social media. It's sad to see people get so caught up with buying the latest things in trend solely to make a statement to the rest of society that they are capable of purchasing expensive things without feeling a genuine connection to them. I've experienced the same thing where I get hung up on obtaining a certain item that holds value to me pretty much because its "trendy" or I've seen someone else owning it. Once I have it however, I don't feel the same kind of excitement and joy I used to have when I still yearned to possess it, and the thing ends up disappearing in the depths of my closet never to be seen again. We truly have been feeding into the capitalist mindset as you described it, where our self worth is masked by the number and price tag of the things we buy. These things do little to reflect our character and personality, only reflecting the vapid and self absorbed parts of ourselves to display for the outside world. It's truly sad to see.

<br><hr>
Reading through the comments, yours grabbed my attention because I too found myself getting very bored and distracted reading this chapter. It was overly detailed. That being said, the text’s main points were very important and relevant to this week’s topic of materialism and, more generally, relevant to the topic of this course. Even though he wrote this in the 19th century, his points are more relevant than ever. As we saw in the movie MInimalism, and now here, people are obsessed with material possessions, and if we learned to let go even a third of everything we owned, we would feel so much more free and happy. As Thoreau harps on throughout, living a simpler life is often living a better life. Just this weekend, I went on a camping trip, and just for those few days, I can attest to such a claim. It is true. When we are cut off from the distractions and material possessions, we often find ourselves a lot more appreciative of the world around us. We are also a lot more in the present.
 <br><br>
Similar to the first quote you mentioned, this one spoke to me: “Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistakes, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them [,] making [them] sick”. A lot of the western world has completely distorted the idea of freedom. Now, it is seen more through desires and wants, rather than what one already has. We have been ingrained with the idea that in order to live a “successful” life, we must work as hard as we can for as long as we can in order to earn the most money possible to buy the biggest, most expensive things. How do we expect to solve the climate crisis if this is our mind set? Wanting and needing more is in no way going to help the planet. We need to shift our focus to a more “Walden” view. We need to value quality over quantity. If he were still alive today to see how badly we’ve come, I can’t even imagine the horror he would feel.

In Engl22 we were required to read all of Walden, which I actually enjoyed. Going back and re-reading the first chapter, Economy, of the book opened my eyes once again to the idea of minimalism. Thoreau, the author, moves to a private, one room cabin by a pond named Walden. You can already see the push for minimalism because of the fact that he is living in a single roomed cabin, and it was very inexpensive, costing him only $30. By doing all of this Thoreau is trying to get back in touch with the natural world and the necessities in life. He is connecting with not only himself, but everything living around him by doing this, and also saving a lot of money by living this lifestyle. Even just in this chapter he displays many benefits of minimalism, and living this simple lifestyle. It was very interesting to read, and made me think about my own life choices. I think of myself as a strong environmentalist, but still catch myself stuck in a strong cycle of consumerism. Our society has taught us that the more stuff the better, the bigger the better, and all you things show how successful you are. In reality the amount of things one has or how big their house is, does not define their success, but their achievements do. Our society needs to switch its thoughts on owning things, which will take a lot of time and practice, but we may be able to end this destructive cycle of consumerism.

The minimalism that Thoreau explores in Walden gives us insight to the reality that we are consumed by today. taking a step back allows us to see how our consumer driven economy and our perceptions of success have led us to perpetually consume more. Thoreau's experiment with minimalism allowed him to see how we can live happily while not conforming to the ideals of materialism. I agree that we should have fewer possessions and instead own only a few staples as necessary. This is not necessarily the widespread belief though since the concept of never being satisfied with what we have and longing/working for more has been one of the core values of an American lifestyle since manufacturing was introduced. Cutting back to a more minimalist lifestyle, if implemented on a large scale, will reduce much of the impact we have on the planet. With that being said, this transition is no small feat since materialism is such a significant part of the American lifestyles we see today.

Thoreau explores elements of Walden pond that have been previously ignored, he touches on highly descriptive components of the pond and things surrounding it. An example of this is sound, this element is not obvious to the eye but Thoreau makes sure to take note of this and describe it in his writing. Like Wordsworth, Thoreau moved to the country to be closer to “God”.
 <br><br>
Thoreau’s perspective on “Nature” must be understood as highly romanticized 
 <br><br>
Because we have largely inherited Thoreau’s view of “Nature,” we cannot forget that this idea was culturally constructed

Having read Walden numerous times before, I had a different perspective after reading the chapter "Economy" this time around. As Thoreau records his time at Walden Pond he expresses his perspective on society, but more importantly society's flaws. He believes that society is so caught up in its materialistic goals, and "and are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors" that they completely overlook the things that really matter. As a society we tend to calculate how well off one is and how happy they are by the things that they own, and that stigma has led to us having "no time to be anything but a machine," because everyone wants to prove themselves to others.
 <br><br>
I found the quote "One farmer says to me, 'You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with'...  walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow," to be really interesting and relatable to the climate crisis. This relates to the mindset that some have today where they believe that we need meat to survive, which could not be further from the truth. There are millions of people that are on the vegan and vegetarian diet that are perfectly healthy, because the nutrients that meat provides us with can be found in other food sources that have a significantly less carbon footprint than raising all of these animals for their meat. Another quote that resonated with me was, "we are compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of change...but there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre." This quote made me think about how those that choose to believe that climate change is not happening right before our eyes are refusing to believe that there is a possibility of change. They believe that our action will have no significant impact when in reality if action has an equal and opposite reaction. Despite the chapter “Economy” being written years ago its main themes are still applicable to life today and it was interesting finding the parallels between the two different eras.

I have also read Walden once before, and similar to what you said in the beginning of your comment, and saw this chapter of the book in a much different way. Part of it had to do with not necessarily zooming on this chapter, “Economy”, alone. As a start I really felt like the film and reading for this week went very well together as both stated that a materialistic life is not the life that one should be seeking to acquire. The quote you mentioned regarding the stigma of happiness being calculated by what an individual owns saying, “no time to be anything but a machine,”is something that I have caught from this reading both times I have read it. It is something that I think about often as I view many celebrities and how artificial many of them look in different pictures and videos. I also enjoyed how you connected the quote referencing the ox and vegetables, being able to relate it to a climate crisis topic. The beef industry releases an enormous amount of methane into the atmosphere and it is quite incompetent to say eating meat is the only efficient way to being healthy when I personally know a handful of friends that are quite honestly healthier than me that do not eat meat. The most compelling part of your entire response in my own opinion was those who refuse to change even when it is for good. It cannot be any more clear how bad the climate crisis is beginning to get, especially in California, and those people believe any change will be insignificant when even small changes will be better than we previously were before. Lastly, I want to express my appreciation for your last sentence about older material being the same amount if not more applicable today. A huge thank you to Ken for being able to see this across a handful of films and books putting them all together to take a proactive stand on such a critical issue.

As I began to read Henry David Thoreau’s 1854 classic Walden, I had a tough time pinpointing exactly what message he was trying to get across. I then found the theme of simplicity used throughout this chapter in which I would like to highlight in my own experience. I live in a small town in the mountains where the closest grocery store and larger town is 50 minutes away. As a kid, I had to adapt. Instead of driving to the closest town to catch a movie or go bowling with friends, my friends and I would choose to go hiking, go to the river, or do other outdoor activities. The grocery shopping made it tough for my parents, but they were able to adapt to the situation and commute once a week to buy a large amount of food for a full week. However, the costs of our larger house, rise in gas prices, and car payments were adding up. We had to make a change. We then installed our own garden which made the grocery trips less costly. I wish however, we would have changed to a smaller house and a vegetable based diet but we were on our way to fulfilling Thoreau’s idea.
 <br><br>
I strongly believe that Thoreau is onto something: simplifying would create a major change. Simplifying consists of smaller housing, less travel, and eating less meat. If we are able to fulfill this idea there would be positive changes that follow within our environment and I hope in my lifetime we are able to accomplish that. If Thoreau lived to see that this century is clearly doing the opposite of what he demonstrated, I think he would be very discouraged and furious. We knew in 1854, that changing to a minimalist way of living would majorly benefit our environment and planet but instead we have just been consuming more and more things that do not benefit us. I believe that life is about serving for our planet and reserving it to truly appreciate the benefits this world has to offer. If we continue what we are doing then there will be nothing left to appreciate. We NEED to take on this challenge Thoreau has laid out for us in order to preserve the planet earth and stop depleting the life of other living things that don’t take part in the destruction.

I completely agree with what you said as I have recently had to learn and adapt to a new environment. It can, in fact, become very tedious to get anything done as simple as buying groceries. However, Thoreau’s suggestion in simplicity could in fact create a major change in our environment, especially today. There are very simple changes that we could make to our lifestyle such as switching from meat to chicken, dairy to almond/oat milk, walking, etc that seem like would create little change by one individual. However, as this simplicity message spreads more widely as it did when Thoreau had released “Walden,” and the more it is accepted and practiced, the greater the impact it will make. I highly believe that there’s definitely power in this. Reducing consumption by practicing simplicity would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and would serve our planet right. If Thoreau were to see what has happened in the 21st century, I agree that he would become discouraged for his plan that didn’t really come to be. However, just as how he had tried implementing such values long before, I completely believe that he would continue to try to do so today. Because of this, I strongly agree with Ken in his statement that our generation and future generations to come have the capacity to create and implement this change no matter how challenging it may be in order to live in harmony with the earth, just as Thoreau had done tried so before.

There was a book I read at some point called "The Blithedale Romance", which Walden reminded me of. I'm not surprised, because both are works with transcendentalist elements. Transcendentalism focuses on the inherent goodness of people and nature, and I was surprised to see that it could be linked to the climate crisis. It makes sense the more you think about it though: minimalist living, "not giving into the whims of fashion", and a simple vegetarian diet are all points that Ken, Hawthorne (the author of The Blithedale Romance), and Thoreau emphasize. A while back, in a different video, Ken explained the different responses that people had when he made suggestions on how to live greener. He said that (generally), people from his generation believed that they should be able to "live how they want, eat how they want, and buy what they want" because their hard work earned them these things. Materialism has long defined the American Dream, but now it is simply unsustainable. We need a cultural shift that will change what we think makes up a "content life", which can only be brought about by everyone's efforts to actively bring about this change.

The transcendentalist perspective is definitely an important one to bring up when reading Walden, considering that leading transcendentalist Thoreau wrote it. They believed that individuals needed to become truly self-reliant in order to engage in a beneficial community, as opposed to the workings of organized religion at the time which they viewed as a hindrance to one's independence. With this in mind, Thoreau harshly critiques college life. His cabin costs the same (if not less in the long term) than a tiny, noisy dorm in the middle of a city. He also decries how colleges encourages an extreme division of labor, which further prevents self-reliance and the ability to observe life with mindfulness. He says, 
 <br><br>


"If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where anything is professed and practised but the art of life;--to survey the world through a telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural eye; to study chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics, and not learn how it is earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune, and not detect the motes in his eyes, or to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured by the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in a drop of vinegar."
 <br><br>


While there are considerable merits to intensive study in one field, it's not for everyone. It can encourage a modern tunnel vision that only worsens the plague of consumerism and materialism, since the highly educated won't realize the true material value of the items they own and collect in their ever increasing homes. It reduces mindfulness, turning us on autopilot in our daily lives. Daily decisions are not considered for their causes and consequences, like the immense amount of water and energy that goes into a mere pound of beef. Raising that cow yourself, however, makes one realize the value of that beef. If more people had this mindfulness when they eat meat, they would quickly switch to a plant-based diet. Not everyone can just abandon modern life to live in a cabin in the woods, but they can certainly make several key changes just like Ken mentioned to severely reduce their climate footprint.

In Walden, nature is seen as an extremely spiritual thing. It is claimed that as a population, we no longer take care of nature, nor appreciate it in the way that it is meant to be appreciated. He is upset with us because all of our time and energy goes into investing in materialistic things. He points out how even farming - which once was an activity that connected people deeply with nature had become materialistic. He points out how farmers these days are so focused on having property and making money from it. I see this being a big issue where I am from. The farmers are doing their jobs so that they can compete with eachother to have the most property and the biggest home. It is sad to see that the animals and the quality of the food often suffers from this competitive and flashy nature. 
 <br><br>

The book claims that you can make everything you need for a year in a few weeks of work. It is a very important lesson that we start to tune into what is important outside of ‘stuff.’ We live in a world where there is a clear belief that you can’t do anything unless you are making a huge wage. In fact, we have a lot of what we need if we just look to natural sources. We used to all live off of the land and there was no issue with that. Now we have a belief that we need a mansion and 4 cars and every new iphone and to buy a huge amount of produce at the store. We should take life back to its roots.

I agree with you on the fact that life should be simplified. Like there is no need whats so ever to have four cars because the majority of the time these cars are going to stay parked in front of the house. People who can afford to own four cars or more are also those who live in mansions but again that is the need to have four full bathrooms and two half bathrooms, with ten bedrooms and more. I cannot see the appeal of living in a house where you might get lost from time-to-time. 
 <br><br>
As you mentioned this outlandish lifestyle has consequences on how we are treating our environments. For example, I read somewhere that areas in the tropical forest were being cleared in order to build a resort. What is the need for that as well? People seek to decorate their life with these experiences and stuff without taking into account the effects they are making by supporting such things from happening.

Minimalism is better for the environment because it reduces consumerism. It is also better for people's overall happiness because it allows people more space to focus on the important things in life such as their personal connections with family and friends. People are less focused on superficial things and have a greater appreciation for the little things in life.

 <br><br>

In terms of Thoreau, even though his actions are commendable, it's important to note that he only actually committed to the lifestyle for a year. Minimalism is a choice of the privileged. Many people, like the Irish family described in Walden, don't have a choice to be a minimalist. Rather, their financial situation forces them to live this way. 

 <br><br>

Still, I think it's important that everyone embrace minimalism. The beautiful thing about minimalism is that you adjust it to your own desires. Minimalism doesn't mean throwing away all your belongings. Rather, it means choosing to keep only the things that are important to you and help you live out your highest purpose. Minimalism makes people have more gratitude for their belongings.

The reading Walden is very inspiring and it especially made me think a lot about the type of lives that everyone is pursuing now compares to the life in a very simple way which Thoreau has experienced and has written in his book. 
 <br><br>
It is the fact that nowadays people care about materials and wealth a lot. We all want expensive things and all types of luxuries. We all want a good job and work hard to earn more and more money and to have good food, clothes, houses, cars, and to be able to travel around the world. It seems that many of us only care about what we are aiming for in the future e.g. success, wealth,etc. But while we are trying to achieve all these things, many of us forgot to pay attention to the lives and moments we are currently living right now. And we forget the things e.g. health, time to spend on doing some other things will make us happy and the time to spend with our beloved friends and family. I am, to be honest, like many other people that live in these days, care about how much wealth I can earn to compare to other people and always want to buy things that I want, think I am lacked of , and other people have but I don’t, I simply want to achieve as much and have as much of things I wish to possess.
 <br><br>
How Thoreau has talked about his experience living in such a simple way was actually amazing to me. And I have never imagine that it is actually possible to do it. Although the type of life that Thoreau lives might not be accepted by everyone and because as in this century, people are all looking for a more comfortable and enjoyable lives. So I think it is actually hard to abandon everything we have now and live in the way like Thoreau does, but his experience reminds us that we shouldn’t focus too much on materialism, but to live in a simpler way that will make us more happy instead of working all time like slaves under market capitalism, to work that hard simply because for a house or some expensive thing we want to buy is something we all should think about if they all worth us to sacrifice our health and happiness.

"It is not necessary that a man should earn his living by the sweat of his brow, unless he sweats easier than I do." With this quote, Thoreau describes how easy and much more simpler life can be if we dropped all the unnecessary "necessities" that is promoted by "civilized" society. Much of what the text condemned--clothing, shelter, and food--point to the minimalistic lifestyle that I have tried to follow while taking this class. In fact, condemning these things isn't the point. It's realizing that we have been placed into and forced to go after social images of success. I found it pretty interesting that Thoreau's condemnation of the fashion industry is still incredibly applicable to today's times. 
 <br><br>
"One would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather consoled the fears than confirmed the hopes of man." I also greatly appreciated Thoreau's commentary on religion. Not only did he call out how society's consumption habits were unethical but also how belief systems have led us to believe that our lives on earth mean little in the grand scheme of things. We have literally been taught to disregard our very lives in praise of things that are not there or await us when we finish killing the planet.

A topic that I find quite interesting is human’s innate connection to pastoral serenity. That is, the idea that humans are naturally happy and fulfilled when  in and working with nature. Though Thoreau’s living experiment at Concord Pond lasted only two years, and was written on the eve of the industrial revolution, his experiences still stand as a testament to the valuable internal feeling that humans derive from nature. 
 <br><br>
Just by simply isolating himself and limiting his intake of consumer goods, Thoreau beings to notice just how much those goods serve to obscure personality or even artificially boost self-confidence, “We know but few men, a great many coats and breeches”. In a similar vein, the movie for this week described how consumer culture in the modern era creates a similar effect, where people start to define themselves not through their values but through the goods that they own. It is often very easy to deny this claim but, even before consumerism was a small fraction of what it is now, Thoreau comes to the same conclusions.
 <br><br>
Another example of the poignancy of Thoreau’s commentary is through his explanation of what it means to be poor, and the difference between being poor in mind and poor in goods. It is very easy for people to fall into patterns of thinking whereby, in comparing themselves to others, they come to the conclusion that they have less and therefore are not “rich enough”. What Walden explores is that, separated from these types of comparisons, very rich interpretations of other people and other relationships reveal themselves.

<br><hr>
Thoreau's commentary on religion was especially intriguing to me as well, because I find its teachings to be so extremely hypocritical when it comes to this topic. Although I highly reject organized religion, I am aware of the 7 "deadly" sins which include gluttony and greed. The complete disregard religion teaches for our life on Earth and main focus on the afterlife perpetuate people's participation in these sins. We partake in overconsumption of not only food, but many other goods as well that we deem to be necessary to our lives. In truth, most of them truly are not, and we are material gluttons without even realizing. The second sin I mentioned, greed, comes along with our refusal to let go of so many of our belongings and want to keep them to ourselves. Having such little regard for our planet and focusing on the afterlife may align heavily with religious ideals, however, aren't we going against religion at the same time by living sinful lifestyles during our time on Earth?
<br><hr>
The sweat of his brow quote is a perfect description of minimalism. Hopefully one day I can live a minimalist lifestyle and fully be able to support myself without much work. To me minimalism if financial freedom. Financial problems are probably one the biggest contributors to stress in life, therefore to live a healthy life would be to be free from financial chains and be able to live comfortably without living. Although I agree with Thoreau's minimalist philosophy, I also see value in work. In my opinion, when you are working for yourself and working on yourself, you get a satisfaction. To Thoreau, even a farmer isn't a true minimalist because he toils the land for excess finances. In my view, the farmer is still a minimalist because the land is his, therefore he isn't working out of stress or to pay off debts but simply to live. Similarly, I would consider myself a minimalist in some aspects because I try to get by using the least amount of resources/stress. Any excess stress that I put on myself wouldn't be healthy. Hopefully one day I can be in a position where I can support myself without working and simply enjoy the gifts of nature. I wouldn't mind living a life away from society and in nature at all. As a matter of fact , I think society is structured in a way that goes against our nature, which ultimately causes stress.

I agree with you, Henry David Thoreau was ahead of his time. I can not imagine how hard it must have been for him. I just feel like during that time the whole country was very ambitious to become successful and for Thoreau just to pretty much say screw that I want to be successful in my own eyes. He did not like keeping up with the “fashion” because he already felt comfortable in his own clothes. Although he did not live this simple life for environmental issues (if they had any at that time) he still helped the environment out. Living this simple life causes us to not consume unnecessary items, which we all know increases our carbon footprint. It is like the film Minimalism they did not live a simple life for the environment but just to be at peace. Like I said in a different comment it is like killing two birds with one stone, by living a simple life, you become happier and you help out the environment. I can not imagine how Thoreau’s book would be in today’s society. He would probably drag everyone for conforming to society’s rule on how to live.

<br><hr>
The quote about the work and sweat from brow just goes two show the disparity of lifestyles across the world. In the U.S. we tend to be more materialistic and entitled. When fights break out in stores across the country when a new pair of J’s drop; choosing to fight over a pair of shoes rather than choosing to be civil and kind to others. 
 <br><br>
In the text, Thoreau stated, “I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than gotten rid of.” 
 <br><br>
Living a minimalist lifestyle is easier said than done.

<br><hr>
I agree that Thoreau's analysis living a simpler time is very true. However, I feel the first quote you mention is very self obsessed. There were and are still many people in the world who have to work ridiculously hard just for basic needs. Of course there are people who work too hard even though their basic needs are met. However, the way Thoreau condemns consumerism has continued to apply to society throughout time. 

 <br><br>

I also agree that religion tends to stop people from doing whatever they can on Earth. As professor has said before some people don't care what happens on Earth because they're so focused on the afterlife aspect of their "life". Even today so many religious people don't support or want to support climate change because some ancient text told them that the Earth is going to burn. This makes no sense to me and I wish people would see what is actually happening rather then what they expect to happen.
<br><hr>
Life would surely be much easier if we didn't feel like we needed all the excess material items that we are told define and display "success". I find it frustrating that our society equates material wealth with success, because we feel pressured to seek high-paying jobs and spend our money on material items that aren't necessary, but purely for the display of status. I was actually just having a conversation with my friend about this at dinner tonight - we talked about how so many of the high status celebrities have gotten to a point where they are far beyond having their necessities covered, and are now basically just in competition to see who looks wealthiest. It honestly annoys me how people feel the need to buy a huge mansion just because to show they are rich - when they will never use most of that space! It's honestly just sad how we are told the narrative and format of how to live, and what it means to be successful. As Thoreau says in this chapter of Walden, "There is only one way, we say; but there are are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one center". I think it's important that all of us, at least at some point in our lives, critically think about whether the life we are living is based just on expectations of society or whether it's a life we're genuinely content and happy with. I also found Thoreau's condemnation of the fashion industry applicable to today's industry. It's sad how people (myself included!) feel pressure to throw out perfectly good clothes because they are "out of style". It's such a waste of resources and of our money. He really was ahead of his time with these ideas, and it would be really interesting if he were still around today to give his opinion on today's even more extreme consumerist society.
<br><hr>
I think this is in particular interesting as points are raised as to "social images of success" and as a result practiced abundantly in our culture. This largely stems from people's of belonging and adherence to most often status. In regard to materialistic acquiring, Thoreau shares "for these are more easily acquired than got rid of," which only reiterates the idea Ken raises of adhering to the readied script for each generation. Over the course of this week, emphasis has been placed on the gradual release of all things through the concept of minimalism. This has been shown as social and personal practice to shed unnecessary weight. The idea of dropping what's not 'necessary' is present within Thoreau work as well in his practice of smaller housing and the fashion industry. A lot of what Thoreau talks about speaks on various types of personal wealth and the social behaviors that help to inform what we derive from them. In targeting the results of these inherit practices, it requires many to be self aware as they play into the cycle, in order to alter what's going on.
<br><hr>
What caught my eye the most was the critique on philanthropy. He says it is a good thing and should not be stopped, but he also says it could be better. He proved that one living the minimalist lifestyle could survive on relatively small sums of money (they seem tiny, but inflation). Thoreau then tells the story of the man who came into his house to escape the harsh winter and wonders how people can be philanthropic when they cause others to suffer. It is a powerful thought, the wealthy have always befitted off of the poor, dating back to ancient times. Thoreau says why is it that they should suffer and you only marginally help. He writes “You boast of spending a tenth part of your income in charity; maybe you should spend the nine tenths…”. He wants the wealthy to live on the same level as everyone else. They cause the suffering, so why don’t they live the suffering themselves. I think if not nine tenths of what they make maybe half or a third, the world could be better. The wealthy clearly do not need all the money they have, and everyone models what they do after the wealthy, so if they live simple humble lives, maybe it would catch on. Maybe would could end the necessity to consume, maybe we could save the planet.

<br><hr>
After reading the first chapter of "Walden" and listening to Ken's video, I drew these same parallels between our life today, what we've been discussing in class, and what Thoreau analyzed. Your point about being placed in these paths reminds me of the discussion about advertising in the Minimalism film, along with Thoreau's beliefs of how consuming affects the wellbeing of a person. Likewise, Thoreau's suggestions to change diet, food, and housing patterns reminded me about Ken's 5 tips in last week's video. These connections are eerily connected to today, further echoing the point that we were aware of our climate destruction long ago. 
 <br><br>


Furthermore, I was also connected to this particular passage. When Thoreau said "let us first be as simple and well as Nature ourselves", I pictured how far we have come from our past. The paths that society sets for us through religion and social norms in an attempt to "better" ourselves only takes us farther and farther away from our purest form in nature. Today, these paths have led us to a consumerist culture that is killing our planet. However, many people are too focussed on achieving societal-defined success to even notice or begin to change their ways.



<br><hr>
I agree with what Thoreau is saying, living without unnecessary complexities would make life easier and much much more simpler.  This is because we would not have any complex and unnecessary things to worry about.  However I believe this is just a mere idea that virtually can never be achieved.  Because of human obsession on luxuries, and always wanting the best items.  Although there are some people who can not get the best and new items, the majority can and will when they get the chance to.  I do find it frustrating how society perceives different things.  Because of the way society views clothing, phones, fashion, luxuries.  People feel the need to purchase the best new things, and this makes life complex and much more difficult than it should be.  Because of this there are many many unnecessary complexities that exist in the world that we live in today.  These complexities also bring different problems to the climate crisis.

<br><hr>
I agree with your statement. I think that much of society, in whatever regard it may be (material or religious), makes us think a certain way. It brainwashes us into thinking that our lives are much less meaningful without X, Y and Z. In today's society, we are so caught up in the societal images of success. These are the "necessities" that you talk about. These are the big homes, expensive clothes, and fast cars. Why do we follow such images and what does it mean to us for these to be so appealing? What do we actually gain from this? We could live a life of minimalism and feel the same exact amount of happiness and joy. In terms of religion, it leads us to believe that this planet is merely a stepping stone in the grand scheme of things; it makes us believe that no matter what we do on this planet, there's always going to be something "greater" for us to achieve and look forward to. Overall, however, Thoreau describes a mentality that is so applicable to today's society. How are we supposed to follow these images of success and live a sustainable and simple life? We don't need everything that we think we need, and it seems like we only pursue these things because they make us feel secure in ourselves and our positions in society.


<br><hr>
The point he made about fashion and how he only had a few clothes that he cycled through was a very compelling and powerful decision for him to make. It reminds me a lot of the Project 333 from the Minimalism film from this week. I think the idea is quite common in today's day and age like you said, Aubrey, and I think this is due to just how the world is now seeing fashion trends. There has been a push to seek older fashions becoming trendy. What I was thinking about while reading this chapter was why these culture shifts that we have seen in fashion are so difficult in other parts of our world. Like why can this same culture shift not apply to cars or becoming vegetarian/vegan? I think a large part of the west coast/fairly liberal states has seen this shift, but I'm not sure how the rest of america feels about it. I think exposing everyone to more facts and even including these readings in high school literature/english classes will get people thinking. After all, you can't decide to make someone live in the minimalist, naturalist ways Thoreau did, but can get people to start thinking and questioning their habits.
<br><hr>
I shared a similar reaction to Thoreau's insights on minimalism and religion. It is quite apparent that consumerism is one of the main destructive forces that is killing the planet, and Thoreau predicted that before it was even this bad. As Americans we contribute to over 1/4 of the greenhouse gas emissions on the planet, and the main reason being we consume so much. I really resonate with what you said about how consumption is related to our social idea of success, as I feel most people's goals in life is centered on being able to purchase a lot of material things that are expensive and environmentally detrimental. It would require an enormous cultural shift in values for this to cease, and sometimes I feel as though that is not possible, as pessimistic as that sounds. Regardless, I'll still try and do whatever I can to practice a more environmentally sustainable lifestyle as well as encourage my friends and family to do so. 
 <br><br>

Additionally, his comments on religion were quite enlightening to me. I have often thought about the flaws of organized religion, but never this one. The little value religion places on our time on Earth relative to our eternal lives off Earth has a correlation with unethical consumption and bad environmental practices, as it leads to people essentially treating our Earth poorly. Thoreau was ahead of his time in so many ways, especially pertaining to his comments on consumerism and religion.

<br><hr>
It is true that Thoreau's concept of minimalism was ahead of its time as he was a free thinker who realized barriers that others didn't. These barriers of forced materialism and fitting into trends of showing wealth and happiness were placed upon us by societal views and are completely unnecessary as they are merely results of our capitalist and economic focused society. As noted by Thoreau these materials and ways of showing off wealth truly do not show the real value and happiness of life being felt thus serving no purpose but to be an impractical social construct. These views of minimalism and only utilizing the true necessities in life can be and should be a model for our present and future generations as it will help eliminate unnecessary waste and reduce the production of greenhouse gases as production slows down in response to lowered demand. Minimalism is the future societal norm our planet needs.
<br><hr>
It surely seems like an idea that can't be achieved, and I don't think giving up ALL complexities from life is good for us at all. I personally believe that adapting a "simpler and happier life" is going to hurt our innovations. I argue that human evolved to be something relatively smarter because our ancestors took a path of seeking more complexities.
 <br><br>

From the film "Minimalism" someone said something like "our compulsive in consuming more is written in our biological fingerprints", that we are born to be greedy and always wants more and grow more complicated to maximized our survivability, or should I say the ones with less complexities failed to compete and didn't survive. 
 <br><br>



Although we tend to be obsessed with more luxuries and consuming at a maximal level, the danger our ancestors foresaw can keep them anxious and make them stay far away from the dangerous source, which means they know when to stop doing dangerous things to survive. Climate crisis however has a long delay affect that bypassed most of our system of detecting dangers(something we need to learn from data, with no obvious immediate effects), result in most of us don't feel anxious or worried about dangerous things happening right now. Thus we have to learn another way other than following instincts to fight against the climate crisis caused by ourselves. Self-educating like what we did now is one way. And we are running out of time to consider whether or not it will hurt our "innovations" if we all just have a "simpler" life-style, it's kind of a necessary sacrifice we all need to make in order to live on...

 <br><br>

And it is of course frustrating because most of us grew up in lifestyle that we are so used to today, and almost all of us accepted it otherwise face with peer pressures. I only started thinking about issues such as climate crisis after taking this course, and think about how large of the course size this is? 700? 800? And how many of us will keep spreading and acting upon climate crisis after this quarter? I understand as now we all see the signals of danger in near future, and we are relatively powerless at this time against that danger, so me too I am feeling frustrated. But I know there are much more we need to do for sure, and losing hope doesn't help us to do our best.

The minimalistic lifestyle sounds like the perfect serene pastoral climate. The idea that humans can be perfectly happy with not much and working with nature sounds bliss. However, we can talk all we want about how this minimalistic lifestyle is the way to live and how much it would change and help the world we're living in now. This is not going to happen in today's climate. With the average American being the exact opposite of minimalistic, we live in a materialistic society. However is everyone read Walden, and actually listened to the message he was trying to convey you would realize that fashion is unnecessary, things, for the most part, are unnecessary, but once again in America's climate today it would be almost impossible to live a complete minimalistic life.

<br><hr>
I agree with you in the fact that many people have the image of a perfect life is one filled with materialistic goods. Growing up, I was influenced by the people around me (parents, teachers, friends, etc.) that earning money in the future as a sign of success. I never was a very materialistic person, I never understood the idea of having a huge mansions with tens of rooms that you don't use or purchasing luxuries when it's unneeded. However,  I find it interesting how the motivation for many people, in one way or another, is the real idea that once you work long and hard enough, you'll get something in return for your work. I believe that this is the area to change as its easier to change someones expectations of success rather than removing it in general. To continue having progressing world, there needs to be changes in the way we think, asking the questions to ourselves, "do I really need this?". Thoreau's idea about the concept of wealthy vs poor is that of context, an individual compared with another individual based on money is a defining value in creating inequality. This shows the systemic problems in our current culture, and this comparison can create the idea of stature in a society. While this doesn't mean that everyone should go out to the woods and live in a cabin, I do believe that people can reduce their materialistic footprint on the earth. This helps to challenge ourselves to move away from a materialistic lifestyle and into a minimalist lifestyle.
<br><hr>
I completely agree that the issue isn’t the consumption of goods itself, but rather how well you are able to see the ways in which material goods/lifestyles applies to your own definitions of happiness and success. Peoples’ attitudes of what ‘success’ means have become too much of a race to live in the biggest house and drive the nicest cars; whoever has the most things wins the race. We start to view material things in terms of how much value and status they may give us, rather than for their utility. Thoreau makes the point that, more often these not, these ideas of societal success misguide people into adopting superficial and excessive lifestyles to satisfy their personal desires and dreams, all while stifling the feeling of agency. It becomes easier to believe that happiness is contingent on the way your life is “scripted”, and that making personal lifestyle changes is too difficult/unfeasible of a task. Thoreau’s ideas are more relevant than ever since it is certain our consumptive lifestyles/culture is no longer sustainable for very long, and that change requires self-reflection and mindfulness of needs versus wants.

I really appreciate your comments about the reading! Especially in regards to dropping all the unnecessary necessities promoted by society. It reminds me a lot of the minimalistic documentary that we viewed this week as well. It’s interesting to see Thoreau’s view on the clothing industry as well and I would have to agree with you in the sense that it is highly applicable today as well! Especially with the production with more name brands that are in such high demand, there is an increasing need to buy more clothes that are not even practical in use, but is popularized by mainstream society. This is very problematic especially in regards to climate change. But Thoreau’s method of living off the land is interesting and I’m not completely sure that it would be feasible with today’s society but I believe that it is definitely something to look into. It makes me wonder however how people would feel about his message today. Would people believe that his ideals are worth it? Or would they just consider him another pretentious figure who thinks of themselves too highly compared to others? I could see both taking place. 
 <br><br>
Thank you for your thoughts though, like so many other people in this thread, I was really fascinated by how Thoreau was able to come to so many conclusions about the society we live in through just removing himself from it and living a simple life that isn’t concerned about the consumer culture that we all live in today.

That is a beautiful quote and I would like to raise this one: "The portionless, who struggle with no such unnecessary encumbrances, find it labor enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh." I loved that quote because it speaks such truth about the worries that rich people have versus the worries of the poor. It is very much the same as the first world problems that we can sometimes step back and laugh at. Isn't it hard enough to just make sure you're fed and warm and dry? I say this all in the comfort of my apartment after awakening on a 3 inch thick memory foam mattress topper with soft and warm blankets and electricity to tell me it's morning. So as far as I can see, many people love the convenience that comes with high living and hate the added stress. What am I gonna feed my children with tonight?(note: not How am I gonna feed my children enough for them to survive?) What are they going to wear to their private school? or What haven't I worn in the last month so that people don't think I'm drab? These are all incredibly absurd questions to those who have little and all very real questions that our parents and we ask regularly.

On another note, while I watch this video as I scroll down the youtube page, 5 of every 6 videos is The 2020 Lamborghini Huracan Evo is an Improved Huracan, or I Gave My Credit Card To Random People, or New Apple Products to Expect in 2020! And I'm not the kind of person who watches reviews or car things or really any of the channels they are recommending to me. We are absolutely Bombarded by this gimme gimme attitude and you've gotta have the next best thing. It's frightening. And like Ken says that Thoreau says, it is important to break away from the life you believe is living and contemplate the importance and the sustainability of it.
<br><hr>
I really like this comment. It focused on the substance of the text rather than summary. she highlighted all of Thoreaus main points but I think it is also necessary to point out something that was brought up when we read this text during English 22. Thoreaus viewpoint of his life at the pond was merely an experiment and not my any means a commintment to a substainable life. Thoreau also went home on the weekends for luxureous meals and silmply quit his experiment after a mere two years. I like Thoreaus points and purpose but i would still like to hear from someone taking the situation al ittle more seriously.

<br><hr>
This quote really dives deep into the social constructs we face everyday. You are absolutely right and Thoreau does describe how simple and easy our lifestyles would be if we dropped all the materialistic views in society. Since taking this class i have been approaching the minimalistic lifestyle as well by not going out to by any more clothes and not wasting stuff basically such as food. I also like how Thoreau speaks on religion. Is there more for us? What is going to happen after? It doesn't matter because we are living now and we are doing things everyday. So we should not forget that one day we will have kids and is this how we want them to live? Of course I would love for my child to have an extremely large house and nice cars, etc.  but for the sake of our lives I would be much prouder as a parent if they approached life the way that Thoreau does in "Walden."

<br><hr>
I appreciate that you pointed out these two quotes and believe that you interpreted them very eloquently. Thoreaus’s writing is a bit difficult to read and you made a very good point that this reading attempts to make the reader question the status quo of life they’re put into. Ken’s introduction of this reading raised important points about how we simply accept the life that has been scripted for us. I think it’s interesting that whenever someone proposes “radical” solutions to the climate crisis that requires a change in the way we live, people scoff and are shocked that someone would even suggest a thing. However, that only goes to show how confined we’ve become to what society’s image of what our successful life should be, filled with materialism and consumerism. 
 <br><br>

Thoreau’s writing was very insightful especially for his time, and I agree with you that it’s interesting how it can be related to even today. It goes to show that some of the points he makes about how we should live our lives transcends time and if more people were to internalize his readings, they’d might question why they don’t simplify their own lives.

<br><hr>

What really strikes is me is that Thoreau shows that he largely fell into the same trap he worried about. As you say, he called out those who tell people to disregard the earth - and then later mentioned that those who abandoned the trappings of the earth to pursue inner wisdom were considered great. To consider the Pyramids a waste of effort, but the Bhagavad Gita a great work of art, shows a clear preference for a type of trapping that he has an affection for. In one breath Thoreau disparages the possessions of his neighbors, while later he praises the walls and land that they use because it has a purpose, despite what Thoreau decried earlier in the essay.

 <br><br>

In general, Walden has a message. However, it is also a message sent in a bottle from nearly two centuries in the past; while we can take what we want, we should realize that while we are much the same we are also much different.

There were many statements in Thoreau’s 1854 classic Walden that grabbed my attention. He stated, that most people are “always on the limits, trying to get to business and trying to get out of debt”. I believe this quote sums up our current 21st century consumer world. When I read this, it made me think about our society’s main focus on economic prosperity. We tend to put so much effort in getting ahold of more than what we need, even when we have the things necessary to live. As mentioned in the chapter, we always find a way to “obtain the superfluities”. The statement, “Yet men have come to such a pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries, but for want of luxuries”, emphasizes our constant craving for things beyond our reach. 
 <br><br>
As this reading brought about the topic of simplification, I began to trace back my thoughts on minimalism. I myself have become frustrated with our consumer world, and although I am guilty of being a consumer myself, I believe simplifying our way of living can serve us in a great way! But I do believe that it is a lifestyle that is very difficult to adapt to. His experience and “mode of life” was a great demonstration for the possibility of living in unity with nature but, I do believe that it is far from reach in our world today.

The lecture mentioned profound questions about how people gain with the labor inputs. At the beginning of the human nature, we satisfied the basic needs of food, safe water and shelters. While the development of technologies, we get more and more. The desire is unlimited and hardly to satisfy because it is easier to approach, here it comes the materialism and consumerism. Exceeding desires push people to explore and even exploits natural resources. “In the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best, and sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants”, but we want more. We always want more. But the resources are limited and scare, when human being occupies more, it means less to other species. 
 <br><br>
I agree a simpler lifestyle will be better to the whole human races which also been promoted from the previous generations: simple five suggestions.

I found the ideas of Walden on living life free and unchained from possessions very interesting. I was surprised by this thoughts on education and what he considered to be necessities. Like explained in Ken’s video in today’s society people are given a role even before they are born and I agree, parents have so many expectations for their children and teach things that have been passed down for generations including the idea of a “happy” life through success. Today’s idea of happiness is connected to the idea of being successful in all aspects of life which is associated with money and property. Thoreau’s classic, Walden, challenges that idea by describing Thoreau’s experience by living a minimalist life and refusing to get tied down by property or labor. Thoreau points out the idea of the negative impact school education has because it makes student Thoreau was a student who graduated from Harvard college gien his position on education. Yet I understand where he is coming from, I agree that school education would of more of a benefit for students if it allowed for more life experience than learning everything from paper, many things that we probably won’t use later in life. For example teaching students more on life skills such as how to do taxes etc.
 <br><br>

I also agree with Ken’s statement about how even during Thoreau’s time period, society was caught by fashion trends and following them. As Thoreau explains, people should conserve good clothes that are not worned out or damaged because it is still good despite it not being the trend. I think nowadays people are always trying to stay with fashion trends and wear what is popular, not as much for the actual use of the clothes. People focus too much on brands, there are clothes that are exactly the same but one is more expensive since it has a logo and is well known. In today’s society and social media everyone is constantly reinforced with the idea that happiness comes from the things you own and how pleasant things look to the public. I am  not saying to live in a wooden cabinet in the middle of the woods, but I do think Thoreau’s experience of being able to live a decent life on his own without much need for things, shows that there is no real need for things it just “wants”. When people are constantly wanting stuff they are never really satisfied and that can lead to unhappiness. There is nothing wrong with having several  positions, but I think we should be more conscious of what we do have than on what we don’t and make the most out of the things we do have. Learning to appreciate what you go have and be humble I think is an important part of being happy. If people focused more on being happy with fewer things, we could produce less waste which would help the environment flourish.

After reading the first chapter of “Walden” by Henry David Thoreau, I was a bit taken aback by the fact that people were believing in a simpler lifestyle as early as 1854. The main reason for my bewilderedness is that when I think of the average life in the 1800s, I already picture a very simple life. It is astonishing that this type of beneficiary environmental intentions was put into practice more than one hundred years ago yet the majority of the public continued to live a lifestyle that evolved into the fossil fuel dominated one we know today. Thoreau’s argument for living a life with only necessities is in many ways similar to the message of the film “Minimalism.” I agree with their notion of purchasing less since mass consumerism in a big contributor to climate change. However, I do not believe that moving into the wilderness is necessary nor beneficial for the environment. This is due to the disruption caused in ecosystems by human interference. In addition, living in the wilderness would only increase the distance that one has to travel for work or for other necessary trips, adding more carbon emissions into the environment. As previously mentioned in the class, cities are actually the most advantageous for decreasing one’s carbon footprint due to the close proximity of necessities and more people per square feet.

You make a good point about the idea that complete seclusion in the woods with the bare minimum is not necessarily the ideal route since it would increase reliance on transportation, increasing emissions consequently. However, I feel that the takeaway from the first chapter of Walden is that going to such extremes can show others that even in these conditions, one can be happy, so that even making small steps in one's life wouldn't change their life to a great extent. Thoreau tested his limits and completely went off the grid for over two years, something that seems unimaginable for most of us. Yet he still found fulfillment by having all distractions from the mundane nature of everyday life cut out. He says that most people work terribly hard, but still continue to live "lives of quiet desperation", and that people are on the search for "a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle dove". In other words, people work themselves like slaves only to never reach the unattainable, and a lot of this has to do with the way people live. His method of only using food, shelter, clothing, and fuel to survive refutes the common ideology that luxury is the ultimate goal and is the epitome of happiness. His life was simplistic: he grew vegetables, studied, and wrote. Nonetheless he found more meaning in this and learned more about himself than he had in years studying at Harvard, disproving the older generations ideology that wealth and materialism buys contentment. The way Thoreau lived his life was indicative of what we can do on a modern scale to diminish our carbon footprint, such as living minimally (he didn't like buying new clothes and kept what he had), as well as reusing objects for new purposes (he used the boards of James Collins' shack to build his new home).

<br><hr>
I like the idea you said moving into wilderness is not necessary and even bad for the environment. Henry David Thoreau did offer a good note that we should live in a smaller home. Like the film “minimalism” told us. We actually can stay in a small room, small house or apartment and live really well. I always said I am lucky since I study in US. Because the dorm in America is way larger than China’s student dorm. Here the maximum number of students live in one room is 3, while my friends’s dorm in China 4 students is the minimum amount, and the space are the same. I’ve asked my friends several times that are you comfortable with it? She told me that “I use to it”. And she said “actually the space is enough for six of us, if I didn’t live in dorm, I don’t even know that I have many staffs that I don’t even remember.” Thoreau had said that being rich is fantasy, and having a big house is the way to show neighbors your wealth. If we throw away our distracting thoughts, small space is enough for us. 
 <br><br>

However, as you said, having small space didn’t mean that we should move into wilderness. Moving into wilderness is just a way to restrict yourself from the luxury world that to limit your desire. But it is not the best place to live. As human, we have to eat, have to buy life supplies, and have to work. Leaving away from the modern world is actually gaining your carbon footprint. Because car is the only transportation you can use to go to outside world. If you want, you can live a simple life at the center of downtown, without going to “forest”. If you can’t restrict yourself, wilderness is the choice, but it is not your only choice.


<br><hr>

I completely agree with your mention of the flaw with living in the wilderness. By moving out there, there might need to be space cleared out so a home can be build and it would disturb the environment that was already there. It would also entail a longer commute in order to get to work or to go buy necessary products that one wouldn't be able to obtain from something like a home garden. 
 <br><br>


It's also true that the lifestyle that Walden was describing during his time is vastly different than the lifestyle many of us are living today. It's important to note that we have access to so much more than Walden did during his time Technology that just wasn't fathomable in the 1800s exists today and is something that people invest in.

<br><hr>
I was also surprised to read that people in the 1800's were focused on a minimalistic lifestyle, but then I began to think that humans were already given everything needed for survival and happiness, and that these people in the 1800s were ahead of their time in realizing this so if they were to continue their pursuit for more possessions it would lead to a life of stress and self-defeat. I would disagree with your comment on moving to the wilderness being worse for the environment, because it requires longer travel time for "work or other necessary trips". If we really get down to it, "work" is a human construct and is not necessary. It is entirely possible to be self-sustaining without an income and just natural resources at your disposal. Cars are not necessary. People lived for thousands of years without means of transportation. Although this all does sound extreme, I agree with you that moving to the wilderness while you still plan on living a basic human lifestyle (having a job and other things considered normal), would not be an effective way to save the planet/reduce your carbon footprint.
<br><hr>
I agree with you and think the Thoreau lifestyle is a little bit extreme. It seems to me that the minimalist approach he took made him feel fulfilled and happy, but that doesn't mean everyone else will have the same experience. From reading the comments, it feels like most people just read the text and blindly agreed with what he said. I for one, am pretty confident that living mostly alone in the woods would not make me happy. However, I do see his point and believe that our culture is a way to focused on consumerism. For example, needing designer clothing, or the fastest, nicest cars, or a house with extra rooms, cabinets, beds, etc, is all just unnecessary. Thoreau mentions that he believes the property to be one of the most dehumanizing things. He believes that accumulating wealth and property is a hindrance to happiness. I agree. People put way too much value into what they have instead of who they are. For me, this was Thoreau’s best point. People get trapped by their own identities. Too often, people focus on who society wants them to be instead of who they want to be. However, I don’t think minimalism and isolation is the solution for everyone. For me, I think self-reflection is important. One of my goals is to lessen consumerism, but just not to Thoreau’s extent. My main goal is to find my own happiness and fulfillment without letting the pressures of society get the best of me.

<br><hr>
I also think it is crazy that people as far back as the mid 1800s were thinking of living a minimalist life, especially because today our society is so consumerist driven that we think all people in the 1800s lived a simple life. The ideas that Walden expresses also remind me a lot of the Minimalism film, in that people can live happier lives with less stuff. Just as walden said most people were “Unable to pay for all the dinners which you have eaten,” like the guy in the movie who lived paycheck to paycheck. 
 <br><br>

I also liked how he said in this “comparatively” free country, a lady’s dress is never done, demonstrating how people live for material things. Thankfully, thrifting is popular now, and I hope it isn’t a fad. I also think living in the woods today isn’t realistic if you still wish to stay connected to society. Cities are the most advantageous, but we need to create efficient mass transportation to truly succeed.
<br><hr>

Like you, I too was completely taken aback by how Thoreau was so ahead of his time. He not only dug deep beneath the surface in identifying the root cause of environmental dismay but Thoreau, in fact, went the extra mile in altering and extrapolating his lifestyle to a more sustainable one in order to combat the potential environmental dismay. To my understanding, it's only really within the last 100 years in which the climate crisis has increasingly inched closer to "doomsday" and to be frank I haven't met anyone with the slightest of pure intentions as Thoreau in this day of age. This is honestly so sad as we didn't have to dig deep beneath the surface to understand the potential threats but rather they are facing us directly in the face, on the surface level, and yet we choose to ignore those threats. Now I do completely agree with your comment in the sense that we shouldn't allude to moving/living in the wilderness as you are right, there are a lot of detriments in terms of urbanizing the wilderness. However, I do agree with Thoreau in the sense that we must cut down on the excessive consumerism. Having grown up in Dubai, consumerism was more than a norm, it was a lifestyle. Having read Thoreau's Walden it honestly rationalized how oblivious the people of Dubai are being. As the book points out, it doesn't take a Gucci wallet or a Supreme shirt to make you happy. We need to detach ourselves from the monotonic view of more is better. Fewer carbon emissions are better. Fewer carbon footprints are better. Less consumerism is better. We must conclude that less is in fact better.
<br><hr>
I agree with your statement that moving into the wilderness to live a life of minimalism, isolated from others, is not necessary or good for the environment. Also, if many people were to attempt to adopt this way of life, it would be impossible to sustain considering the limited wilderness left at our disposal and the large populations we possess it would be rather difficult to isolate oneself. I also enjoyed your comment about cities and how it is better to live in small apartments in complexes and the tight inter-connected aspect of cities typically leads to more public transportation and thus lower carbon emissions.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with the statement that moving into the wilderness is not an ecofriendly idea and wouldn't logically make sense with the number of people on this planet.  And along with the statement you made that we would travel farther distances with cars releasing more carbon emissions, the move to wilderness would hurt the earth much more than it would help it.  However, I think Thoreau's overall message in the first chapter of Minimalism is something to take note of.  Living a life of excess is not everything that it is help up to be.  Cutting down on unnecessary possessions may be freeing as your happiness isn't tethered to what society says will make you happy.  I agree that themes in the first chapter of Thoreau's book heavily reminded me of the film of Minimalism we watched this week.  They both tell of the benefits of living a life based on needs and not wants, but just from different time eras.  Thoreau was one the pioneers of the minimalist lifestyle and the people from Minimalism just modernized his ideas.

As Ken mentioned that Thoreau is the grandfather of minimalism, who chose to live a rustic life in a small cabin. His idea inspired many people, and the book "Into The Wild" is impacted by his book. Furthermore, his concept of living in a small house is still advocated today. Moreover, he pointed out that people should not follow fashion, and they should some clothes that are sturdy. Additionally, he suggested that vegetarianism is the destiny of the human race. Also, people ought to consume locally instead of buying something that is imported. 
    <br><br>
 In my perspective, it is true that we are behaving the life which scripted by the last generation. We are just focusing on the convenience of technology, and we ignore the side effect which makes the whole life on Earth go to extinction. However, it is quite challenging to make people choose minimalism since they have to give up lots of things. Although it may make them feel uncomfortable at first, they will feel the freedom of getting rid of materialism. In addition, we should not follow the lifestyle which stipulated by the last generation, and we need to correct their fault. Moreover, their experience can not help us since the world is different between their generation and our generation. If we just follow their way, the climate crisis can not be solved. Minimalism is the first change people should make, and it is necessary to mitigate the climate crisis.

I agree that it will be very difficult to have people choose minimalism. Our society is not a minimalist society. In the bigger picture of the climate crisis, I think that we should be gradually introducing these things into everyone's lives. If people want to make the big jump to a minimalist lifestyle, plant-based diet, and move away from fast fashion among other materialistic things then they should, but considering the amount of climate change deniers that there are, I think that we should be encouraging smaller changes in everyone's lives instead of a huge change in everyone's life.
    <br><br>
Thoreau is among those who I would listen to as he advocates for a minimalist lifestyle among other things. I have a hard time with politics and politicians who do not practice what they preach. Too many people in power want to see everyone else make a drastic change in their lifestyles while they sit comfortably with their materialistic things. The things that we have been discussing this week remind me of a lot of Diogenes and his simplistic lifestyle. Everyone could survive off of the things that they can carry on their backs, but in an advanced society, which we now have, it's hard to imagine people giving up their houses and their electricity for the planet, especially when the majority of the people who created this problem won't feel the repercussions. 
    <br><br>
While Thoreau addresses the fact that if you own less, you would technically have to work less in order to achieve your minimalistic lifestyle, I don't believe that encouraging people to work less will encourage our society to keep developing. Much like the film for this week where people were quitting their jobs and working less to accommodate their new lifestyle, we need to think about how money is an incentive to do well in the jobs that we have created in society. Yes, some jobs make more money, and yes some jobs work longer hours and arguably harder than others, but they are all necessary and even if it means having a simpler lifestyle, we can still be passionate and driven about what we do for a living.

When I was reading “Walden” again, I realized so many things that I didn’t in the last time. I thought that this book is about against consumerism, but I didn’t imagine that this book is also about the education of the value of true happiness at such an early time. Since Engl23 starts, Professor Ken has been inferring that the influence of the last generation on environmental education and protection is severe. The “Walden” is somehow saying that don’t be restricted by some of the meaning of life that imbued to you. In the book, he mentioned that he thinks it is sad to be born with a fortune. It doesn’t make you free to have a lot of things. You will be bound to them, and it will limit you instead. I think this notion is very inspiring for me. We always think that a man free from every financial limit should own a big house and fancy cars. However, these “free” people have to limit to work and keep paying the tax to make themselves own them. This is not true freedom.

    <br><br>

We need to start to educate people near us or maybe the next generation about the true meaning. This takes time. “Walden” did wake up some people, but it didn’t make most of them start to act and change. However, this is why we should hurry up. Stop doing the wrong things. That Fossil Fuel Industry tried everything to let teachers teach the students and children the wrong things are not forgivable.

I agree with all your comments, especially that the people who think they are free that limit to work and paying taxes are, in reality, not free at all. Through this intensive reading of the first chapter of Walden, I really got drawn to his idea of simplicity and the importance of nature. He emphasizes that although some may be against a minimalist lifestyle, it is not only beneficial for ourselves but also is optimal for our descendants and future generations. Ken has already talked about the effects of the boomer generation on newer generations today, which leads me to think that if we all in this generation changed our lifestyles to be more simplistic, we can have such a positive impact on our future generations. There are always going to be people that will contradict the minimalist lifestyle because they will say that they work hard to get all these nice and luxurious items, which is a fair point. However, we need to keep the life of our planet at very high importance and maybe instead of using our hard-earned money for luxurious items, maybe we can use them to live healthier, more comfortable, and overall better lives for ourselves.


<br><hr>
Your comment had a lot of things that I would agree on as well. I especially agree with how we need to change our way we educate people so that a better understanding is made for what it means to be free. There is a sense of urgency in doing this because of the modern problems that we have today, with fossil fuel companies spreading propaganda about climate change in their favor. I read this book again because I took Engl22 before with it and saw new things when reading it that you brought to light. If we are truly happy with our lifestyle by controlling what we have within reason, then our consumerist ideals can be dismayed because we come to love with what we have. To be more comfortable with a minimalist lifestyle even though people want to have more than they need, can teach future generations the true value of appreciating what one has. In the book, it talks about how men do not understand the true value of a house and will chase a wealth that can never be satisfied. It is important to consider this because like you said with paying taxes to make themselves own items, that time and money used to be doing this can be used to pursue other parts of life that may have not been considered once before.
<br><hr>
I also realized many new things when reading Walden for the second time. When I read this the first time I didn’t understand the true meaning and also thought it was just attacking consumerism. While it is attacking the thought of consumption, it is also trying to show the true meaning of consuming less. Thoreau criticizes the goal of materialism and believes that everyone should live a life with the bare minimum. I do agree with Thoreau and the fact that we are way to caught up with materialist items instead of focusing on the more important things of life. Similarly to the two short films I watched, Thoreau also agrees that excessive work prevents people from plucking the "finer fruits" of life, like leisure and friendship. Thoreau states that if we live a minimalist life, we won’t have to worry about spending most of the week working. We can instead focus our time on friendships. I also agree with Thoreau's theory that expensive homes are unnecessary. Growing up in Orange County I was surrounded by a lot of houses that were unnecessary too big and always thought this. It is ridiculous to see only two people living in a house that resembles a mansion. While there are things I do agree with, there are also a couple things that I do not agree with. Thoreau is trying to change everyone’s lifestyle to the BARE minimum. I agree that we all need to cut back on consumption, but I don’t agree with the fact that we should completely give up everything we have ever worked for. This is just unrealistic. We need to instead take small steps to slowly get rid of unnecessary items we own. While I do believe we need to make this change, it will definitely be a hard one. Most people are not going to be willing to just give up everything. By taking these small steps we can focus on the more important things of life instead of focusing on consumption. Buying luxury items consumes our lives way too much and I do believe it makes us unhappy. If we can cut back on this consumption we can start to focus on our own well beings and become happier with the people around us.

<br><hr>
I agree with your ideas that "Walden" tells people to find the value of true happiness. He tells about his own experience to demonstrate true happiness can be simple and people can still find a way to sustain themselves in such a simple lifestyle. Today, people's values have changed tremendously in modern society. The needs in life keep growing and there are just too many things around people. The times are changing and people's fortune is accumulating and becoming wealthier. The luxury goods of the last generation become a normal life necessity for the current generation; such as televisions, computers, cellphones, etc. Life is more convenient, cars, airplanes, trains, are much and much more accessible. But still, people might still remain unsatisfactory with their lives.  

    <br><br>

"Walden" does wake some people up. The consumerism, however, is still common and wins people's hearts. And the modern economy is tightly related to consumerism, a nation sustains with this type of consumeristic economy.  In the end, true happiness is simple and can slow people's hearts and steps down. Nevertheless, there is a long way to go towards true happiness in this modern society.

Honestly, if Thoreau were to currently see the life we live in this century, he would be extremely shocked and disappointed. The entire time I was reading this beginning chapter of “Walden”, I continuously asked myself, what would our planet be like now if this text would have had more of a stronger impact when it was written, so strong that everyone who read it actually did change the ways they were living, and actually changed the script that was written out for them. It’s clear that in general, humans are extremely materialistic, mostly because in today’s society, materialism is a measure of success. How much you have of something, the type of car you’re driving, the brand of the clothing you wear, all of these attribute the level of success you have achieved.
    <br><br>

 A part of his text that really caught my attention was when he began explaining what he meant by the words “necessary of life”. He brings up the luxury man has created on earth, and how even cats and dogs have acquired the same second nature. When I read this statement, I thought about people who dress up their pets and treat them as humans, making materialistic items a part of their everyday lives, items that the dogs don’t need whatsoever. When I thought about this and how strongly so many people feel about how useless it is to treat dogs as if they were humans, I realized that these types of opinions could be centered towards humans, too, yet they aren’t. When it comes down to it, and what Thoreau discusses throughout this text, is that we really don’t need much to survive. Yet we continue to live a life that says otherwise..

When you say that Thoreau would be both shocked and disappointed if he were to see the way of life that many of us live today, I definitely agree. Although I personally find his work to be difficult to read, and a lot of things that he said in the first chapter of "Walden" had their meanings lost to me, I was still able to comprehend the basic message he was trying to get across, as well as a few profound sentiments here and there. Walden was definitely meant to be a sort of warning or rallying cry for people to take a serious look at their lives and try to change their ways. Unfortunately, as we know, human beings - specifically those in developed countries - continued to live lavish lives full of consumerism and materialism.
     <br><br>

It's true that we really don't need much to survive. Humans are remarkable in how we can form rational thought and communicate these thoughts with each other very effectively. It is what has led to the creation of philosophy, religion, economics, politics, virtually every aspect of human interaction. It has also led to the creation of technology, industry, infrastructure, etc. In the modern and even the pre-modern era, societies and civilizations around the world have greatly improved and upgraded thanks to these advancements: this is the basis of the developed world. Compared to people from hundreds of years ago, people who live in developed nations such as the United States, the countries of Europe, Japan, etc, have free time and opportunity for leisure that unimaginably exceeds what any common person could ever possibly dream for, back then. Now there are so many people who no longer need to worry too much about the extreme necessities of survival. You can go down the street to the supermarket to buy an abundant amount of food. You can live in cities and towns with sets of laws accompanied with law enforcement, greatly increasing your personal safety. After a long day of work, you can relax on your couch and watch some TV before falling asleep; there’s no need to worry about this season’s harvest for your crops, or planning out a trip to the nearest well to fetch water. 
     <br><br>

With such leisure, without the constant worrying about basic necessities and survival, it is only natural that humans would now want to improve their lives. They want to gain more satisfaction, have even more leisure, and live even easier lives. It is because of this that we, people living in developed nations, have embraced lives of consumerism and materialism. Hundreds of years ago, the average person might have chiefly been concerned with the weather, and how it might affect their crops and livestock, thus directly affecting what they’d be able to eat for the next few months. Today, we go out and order fast food on a whim. We can casually pull up to a cheap restaurant and get exorbitant amounts of food. Sometimes we throw away huge amounts of food, wasting it in the process. It’s this change in how society functions, brought about by advancements in technology and infrastructure, that has directly changed the way we live our lives. And our willingness to embrace such lifestyles, to increase our satisfaction and happiness, has proven to be disastrous to the environment, strained and unable to provide for our lavish ways.

Reading Thoreau's reading of chapter one, it reminded me of a book I read in high school. The book "Hatchet" by Gary Paulsen where a 13 year old boy who was stranded in the wilderness after a plane crash, owning nothing but his clothes and a hatchet his mother gave him. He then had no option but to live in the wilderness and survive with only his own knowledge. Reading that book as a teenager in high school sparked ideas in my head about what I would do if I were to live in the wilderness. I think what interested me most was seeing how long I could survive on my own, with the freedom of my own will, like Thoreau. While Thoreau's intentions were different than mine, his points that he makes throughout the chapter made me realize that living in the middle of nowhere isn't just for fun, but because the necessities that we rely on are the only things we need for basic survival. That people like the poor could pull this off if they realized that comparing themselves to the rich is a not a practical thing to do. Thoreau, once he had everything figured out for basic survival, saw that he only needed to work 6 weeks out of the year to be able to sustain himself. I think the reason why this reading was assigned was to make us realize that if we cut off the things we didn't need it could possibly be beneficial to our climate in the sense that we wouldn't need to producing all these unnecessary items.

Consumerism definitely has a huge negative impact on our environment, and Thoreau clearly illustrates that we don't need all of the things that our society normalizes; changing how we view the necessity of all the things we consume has a huge positive effect on our environment.
     <br><br>
I think it's important to keep in mind, however, that the way this looked for Thoreau in the 19th century may not be quite the same as how it looks for us. We don't need to move into the wilderness and live off the land like Thoreau did, or like in "Hatchet" in order to achieve the way of life that Thoreau depicts. In fact, romanticizing this way of rural life may in fact harm our environment even further, as we've learned that living in a city is likely the most environmentally friendly option.
     <br><br>
I agree with why you think this reading was assigned, but additionally I think it's important to recognize that Thoreau implores us to not follow the way of our seniors, saying "“What old people say you cannot do, you try and find that you can. Old deeds for old people, and new deeds for new.” This is the main message that I drew from this chapter: we don't need to follow the template that's been made for us, complete with countless belongings and McMansions and cars and endless consumption. We can cut off unnecessary items that we've been told we need by our seniors, we just need to be able to recognize that it's not too late to radically change how we live.

After reading Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, I am really interested in the idea of simplicity and back to nature. What he depicted and illustrated is simplistic and satisfying since everything he did, and the need was made by his hands. He would not worry about materialistic things and pursue consumer culture. Although it may seem to be unfashionable and even “poor”, but the author could find enjoyment and satisfaction of himself and find himself as a true person. It is not only a process of self-achievement but also an effort to help the environment and individuals, both the author himself and people who are still drawn by the materialistic world. I am totally immersed in Thoreau’s writing. The facts he claimed and depiction of his rustic life also attract me. 
     <br><br>

The concept of simplicity and minimalism is really attractive and adaptable. They will not only change a person’s life in reality but also help him to live more happily and satisfyingly. For me, I believe that it is a good idea and I should try to minimalize my stuff because it could help me reduce my stress as I am overwhelmed by too many objects. Although living in a place far away from the city for years seems to be unrealistic and impossible for today’s world, trying to have a minimalistic life could also be helpful economically and environmentally.

"Walden" by Henry David Thoreau is a thought-provoking book for me without doubt. After reading it, I begin questioning my life style and have a deep understanding about the new way of living, which I merely think about before, that is, a simplistic life. Thoreau notes that people are born with land, house, and tools so it is hard to forgo these things since they are so easy to obtain. Then, they waste all their lives in working and pursuing meaningless money. The process is painful and exhausted, but still ends with worries and unhappiness. Thus, Thoreau started considering other possibility that enable people to get away from the vanity and materialism. He built a wood house nearby Walden, planted vegetables, and enjoyed the beautiful nature. Without the desire to consume endless products to satisfy his wants, however, he lives with more joy than people in the city do. This minimalism life truly arouses my interest since I am also fond of nature and sick of consumerism. Though it is impossible for me to live somewhere far away from city now, I can change my living habits. For example, I can buy as less as unnecessary products and do "danshari" once a month. Choosing minimalism has another benefit, that is environmental friendly. The new style of living greatly helps to mitigate the effect of climate change and save the planets. For all the reasons above, and holding the belief that Less is More, I will continue living simple life.

I agree with what Ken mentions in the lecture video: “Thoreau can be the great grandparent in the modern minimalist movement.” Thoreau points out plenty of facts and truths to explain how people pursue luxuries and unconsciously desire many things in the nineteenth century. Many people these days just want to buy expensive shoes and clothing, making others jealous or showing off their upper family background. This has become a phenomenon that people see it normally. Nevertheless, the idea promoted in the reading is to live in a simple and back to nature life. I feel the same as you in which minimizing stuff in life can actually reduce stress and depression. The thing people have to learn is not to get attracted by things that are not considered necessities. We have to control ourselves in this complex world. In order to partly solve the issue of the climate crisis, the minimalist movement is absolutely an adaptable and plausible method to put forth.

When I first read Walden in high school, I thought Thoreau was whack. He willingly went out to the forest, lived in a tiny, modified tent for two years and then came back to live in the city. At the time I misjudged Thoreau and missed the entire message of his move away from society. A guy like Thoreau came from a wealthy background and got to study at a pristine university. Just by these two facts people would say he lived a "good life". This is where the problem starts. In our society today we put things like wealth, reputation, accumulation of the best goods on a pedestal. As Ken has stated in class, it is ironic how these things that make us seem better in the eyes of those around us, but actually these are the very things that are killing our planet. Owning multiple lavish homes, cars, clothing, are all major contributors of CO2 into the atmosphere. What Thoreau is trying to convey with Walden is a simple life. It is sad that his lifestyle seems so crazy and outlandish for many of us. That just comes to show how we have been brainwashed to think that we need more stuff, the best stuff, in order to be happy. It is not inherently our fault, as Ken has noted, that we all have been forced into a role that we must play since birth. But, now is the time to step out of the mold and try to get back to a simpler way of life. I normally categorize my parent's childhood as a simpler time, which is true, but their lives were still lavish in comparison to Thoreau's lifestyle. Thoreau's proposed way of living resembles Socrates' first city. A city where everyone can survive off of the bare necessities. Before, philosophers have acknowledged this first city, but it had been completely overshadowed by the second city. In this city, not only are the bare necessities met, but it entails a life where people have more and are thriving. This idea of the second or true city is created because some philosophers concluded that people are by nature always wanting more and are never satisfied. They were not wrong. Today, our society completely resembles the second city. However, there is reason to start to go back to the first city. With all of the damaging effects that the second city brings, it is time to fix this mess and find a simple life. It will be difficult considering how social media has been a large supporter of the glamorous second city. People love to flaunt their cars, clothes, everything, and this generates this constant want to have more.  I would argue that this feeling of not being satisfied with what one already has has gotten incredibly worse from Ken's generation to our generation, thanks to social media. If social media turns out to be a passing phase, there is hope in diminishing our want for more.

I agree with you, when I first read Walden in highschool, I thought he was wack too. It was funny to me how he willingly went out to the forest, lived in a tiny, modified tent for two years and then moved back to the city after two years. That's right, a guy like Thoreaus came from a wealthy family and he went to a good school. He doesn't really have the right to suggest what people should do.  It's true, our society today people put things like money, reputation, and objects on a  pedestal. We live in an extremely materialistic society. People love expensive, luxurious things. However, humans as a whole are societal animals. We built civilization from the bottom up, and if everyone wanted a simple life, why would we have civilization in the first place? Studies in  psychology have also shown that people are less happy because they are alone in the world, and I believe that this simple life would consist of just living alone with your immediate family. This does not build a sense of community at all. In addition to this, how would everyone be able to find a simple life to live? We would just regress back to a time where technology wouldn't be advanced.

Having already read Walden from Hiltner’s English 23 class, I instantly understood right away as to why he would bring it up again in this given class because of its significance as the birth of modern environmentalism through Thoreau’s time he spent in the woods next to Walden pond in Massachusetts. Other than that, rereading it reinvited me to many things that I forgot when I first read this very work in English 22. “No man ever stood the lower in my estimation for having a patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that there is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience”, this quote by Thoreau stood out for me because of the fact that it highlights his transition from his prestigious lifestyle into a lifestyle we would call today as minimalistic. For Thoreau, this was a small venture into the woods which would ultimately end up showing otherwise, and opening his environmental consciousness and view the goods we possess as many things we take for granted and for uneed reasons. “Outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are our epidermis, or false skin, which partakes not of our life, and may be stripped off here and there without fatal injury; our thicker garments, constantly worn, are our cellular integument, or cortex; but our shirts are our liber, or true bark, which cannot be removed without girdling and so destroying the man. I believe that all races at some seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt”, yet again, this opens another opening lesson here from an environmental approach that Thoreau grew upon through his venture which he exhibits within this given quote. What is quite interesting here is Thoreau’s analogy between the bark of a tree to the clothes we wear on the bare skin of our body, as in his analysis the removal of the clothes from the body of man would “destroy” man in by revealing his bare and in a deeper context, our clothes are what signify our civilized lifes. Returning to the other quote, it explains why he relates to many others in the fact that we all have urges to repair holes in our clothing because of the many reasons that it's our bark being exposed to the bare wild of man. In many ways, Thoreau is pointing at the fact that we truly take for granted the deeper background of the materials we all own, and as a minimalist he would grow to be, the urge to repair is far better than buying the entirety of a new object that would have overleading consequences behind it. 
     <br><br>

Away from the minimalist direction on the environmental approach that Thoreau heads down, he also advises a very important lifestyle change that would better benefit the planet as ken even stated, through changing our diets into a plant based diet. “I learned from my two years' experience that it would cost incredibly little trouble to obtain one's necessary food, even in this latitude; that a man may use as simple a diet as the animals, and yet retain health and strength”, this quote is very interesting in the fact that Thoreau became aware that a human being can sustain a healthy life through the planetary style of diet as shared by the “animals” in the time this was written in 1846. This was ahead of his time, especially in a era when the heavy weighted individuals showed a sign of far greater wealth and meat was the primary diets of the many because it was prominent in the European life sprinkled on the United States since its birth, to which he even quotes a very eye opening quote right after stating, “Yet men have come to such a pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries, but for want of luxuries; and I know a good woman who thinks that her son lost his life because he took to drinking water only”. Yet even with this knowledge, the arise of vegetarianism and even vegans wouldn’t explode till 1971 in the United States, amd even with that, Thoreau even comments on how much more economically sustainable a planetary based diet can be beneficial to families at this time because of the fact that it was cheaper and gave you the same and if not better dietary benefits. As we have come to understand in Ken’s class, the move towards a planetary diet will be better for the planet as the livestock industry in the United States alone is one of the biggest polluters of greenhouse gases and the vegan based diet would reduce the need for these animals. In conjunction to the minimalist values shared by Thoreau, highly the 5 steps we can take in Ken’s path to change our lives for the better follow the basic guidelines stated in this opening chapter of Walden.

I was a little confused when I saw the reading for this week was Walden.  Not because of the quality or authenticity of the work, but due to the seemingly unrelated nature to the climate crisis.  In fact, even after reading it, I still had some questions.  Thoreau made several great points including how people inherently are dissatisfied with what they have and long for more.  An example of this (though not made by Thoreau) is the smartphone industry.  Most carriers now have a 2 year exchange policy.  In other words, after you have had your current phone for 2 years, you can exchange it for the latest model at a modest fee.  This is incredibly wasteful and is only an issue because people want the 'social status' of having the latest technology.  

     <br><br>

There is another book titled The Four that talks about how 4 major companies (Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook) control much of the world.  The chapter on Apple is particularly telling, explaining how Steve Jobs figured out how to turn Apple into a luxury brand.  Since all of the Apple stores have a glass front (and are sometimes entirely glass), people who buy from Apple feel superior to all of their peers.  Not only do they have a great product, but they can be seen by others as they purchase it, thus increasing their social standing.  This is another example of Thoreau's argument that people always want more.  There is no satiation point.  

     <br><br>

After reading Walden, I watched the documentary Minimalism, which helped explain the relevance of including this in the class.  Unless we as a society change to prefer only the items that bring us joy or happiness, then we will never be able to take some of the necessary steps that could help reverse climate change.  Though I feel Thoreau goes a little too far when mentioning how man should only have all that is 'necessary for life', the principle idea is sound.  We need to drastically cut back on consumption if we are to have a fighting chance against the climate crisis.

I shared a similar reaction after reading this first chapter of Walden and wondered after the first section of this chapter how he was going to relate his view of wanting to simplify life to the climate crisis that is at hand. As I read through the rest of the chapter however, I did not find this connection but on reflection on the writing I understand its point of view. Having already read books like "Into the Wild," the writing style of Thoreau illustrating his life at his cabin along the shore of the pond reminded me a lot of the writing I saw in "Into the Wild" and "Hatchet" for example. It seemed to be trying to portray the beauty of a simple life and the significance that all his days and the actions within these days had. During his time at the cabin, he seemed to find purpose and deliberation in what he did which he contrasted with the busy, clutter filled world that he described at the beginning of the chapter.

     <br><br>

After finishing the chapter I tried putting it in perspective of the climate crisis and the connection between the two seemed clear as day to me. By simplifying one's lifestyle similar to the way Thoreau did, you can limit your burden on the environment and reduce your own waste that builds up so fast in our trade based economic society where we buy and buy and buy to satisfy our needs to increase our social status. One part of the chapter that really resonated with me was when Thoreau states "the more things you have the poorer you are." The reason this hit home was because it really sums up what minimalism is about in a short, powerful statement. The more you buy, the more you want to buy. So when you keep purchasing things upon things, you are loosing touch with what means the most to yourself which Thoreau says can only be discovered through self-critique and examination which is impossible to do when you have surrounded yourself with so much stuff that you cannot get through to your inner core of what matters. It is then Henry Thoreau's story of Walden that shows how he was able to continue simplifying his life until he could better understand himself and how to live a meaningful life away from the noise and clutter that pollutes our society.

When Ken announced in class that students had been reading the spark notes for this chapter I wasn’t aware why because I had not read it yet. But now that I have tried to read it, I understand. I have really loved learning about the Climate Crisis so far, I have watched every film, every lecture video, and read every text. However, this text was challenging to get through and I personally don’t think was very helpful because all I could focus on was trying to understand the writing. Maybe it is just me but I have always struggled to read writing similar to this, it reminds me of English Lit courses in high school when we were assigned books like Othello by William Shakespeare. That claim may be a little dramatic but it really turned me away that quickly. I actually found my self-searching summaries and analyses of this text not to cheat but to actually understand what it is the writer was talking about. 


     <br><br>

After watching Ken’s video recapping the reading, I had a better understanding and wished I actually watched that before reading. Throughout this reading I was looking for an “ah-hah” moment where it all clicked and I found it when reading this quote; "In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain one's self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we will live simply and wisely; as the pursuits of the simpler nations are still the sports of the more artificial. It is not necessary that a man should earn his living by the sweat of his brow, unless he sweats easier than I do.” From this quote on, I was able to read through the rest of the text and then briefly skim back on the first half as well. Embracing minimalism, keeping our lives simple, consuming and using raw material, to live by our basic needs.  One thing that stood out to me the most were the expenses that he shared with us, recording how much money the life that he created was costing him. When we really look at our basic necessities and how to meet them it shines on a light on how much money we are throwing away into pointless consumerism. If Thoreau was witnessing our current society today I think his mind would be blown. We are so deep into this hole, that living a life like Thoreau did seems impossible. People own houses with 15+ bedrooms, 20+ cars, airplanes, yachts, etc… I don’t think it is possible for our society to “rewrite our script” because our “overly-bloated” life is so far past that.  I think that Thoreau’s points are important because it showcases perfectly that you can live off of only what you need for little money and still be “successful, happy and free”, the issue is that what we need is blurred with what we want. Our societies are far too advanced to be able to step away and build cabins and grow our own food. I really do think it is important to break away from this cycle of desire, status, and greed but as Americans everyone always wants more and more and for things to be bigger and better. It is unfortunate but I cannot see how anyone would be able to follow this guidance and change his or her way of life.

A quarter of the way through trying to get through this week’s reading, I simply could not concentrate because I had no clue what he was trying to say. So, I decided to read some of the comments to try to get a sense of what this week’s reading was about and stumbled across yours. And thank god I did because I ten followed your advice of watching the video first and I kind of understood what Thoreau was saying when I reread the chapter again. I can honestly relate to what you said about how this reminded you of high school. This text was challenging to get through. The only way I can describe it is that it has really florally language. 

     <br><br>

You bring up a really good point about how Thoreau was able to do so much with so little. He truly embraced his minimalist ways and advised others to do so simply because happiness should not be defined on by the things we own or possess. In this chapter, he also Thoreau also states, “Most men…through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.” I think this has to be one of the most eye opening things I read because he’s basically saying that people are engaging in pursuits that are not natural for them .So, in a way, you bringing up how people own houses with 15+ bedrooms and 20+ cars really shows how they’re not proving to themselves that they can buy these things, but it’s because of how they are conditioned to believe that this is how people view success. It draws them away from fully being themselves, which also draws them away from the genuine and good things that life has to offer.

Henry David Thoreau’s Wallace takes into account the concept of the American Dream, even at its earliest stages. With this work in mine, it had me thinking: the idea of the American Dream is purely superficial. It seems like this “dream” has become a scheme for society to establish ourselves based on socioeconomic status and whether or not we are capable of securing an abundance of tangible items. Companies cater their products and in turn, we keep our best interest toward what we have grown accustomed to doing: consuming- regardless of the products’ usefulness in our lives.
     <br><br>


Although Walden was written 150 years ago, there are still aspects of it that remain applicable to modern times. How much of what we have is what we truly need for survival? Without it, would our social status change?

I agree that taking after the life that I have planned to live since I was born would be terrible for the climate. I feel the pressure from everyone in my life to (after college) get a four-bedroom house for a family of 2-3, a big SUV, a commuter car, have excess amounts of food, have the house redone with decor, etc. If you would've asked me a couple of months ago, if I saw my life going towards anything different, I would say not. But since I enrolled in English 22 and now English 23 I realized that those luxuries don't bring any more happiness after you have become used to them and have the bare necessities.

In Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” he explains the benefits of his simplified lifestyle. Thoreau argued that the only necessities we need are clothing, food, fuel, and shelter; however, the lifestyle most people choose to live now is the polar opposite. He makes a great point when he mentioned that people need to work more in order to own more. For instance, if we want to purchase a bigger home, we need to work significantly more in order to make the purchase. As Thoreau described, “Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meager life than the poor.” I thought it was interesting how Thoreau said that it would be wiser to live a simplified lifestyle because not only will it be environmentally better for the Earth, but it would require less work. I think that many people tend to overwork themselves because they try to achieve the type of lifestyle their neighbors have.

I also really liked that Thoreau communicated that a wiser life can be achieved through the means of simplifying our life. After all, Thoreau takes pleasure of having nature nearby while he builds his house. I feel like Thoreau really wants us to see the beautifulness of simplicity. For him, nature provides everything you need to live such as food. When he makes his bread, Thoreau figures how to prepare it with a very simple recipe. I saw more beauty in the simplicity that Thoreau describes when he mentioned how much money he wasted. Thoreau was able to cover his expenses by working just six weeks out of the year. I also like how this follows his other idea that over working is not good. Thoreau really likes to be free and at the same time does not want more money than what he already has because he knows that for more money, he would have to work even more which could become a hardship. Again, working as a hardship to sustain oneself is not good. I honestly feel like we should also try to simplify our lives in a way because happiness because we are doing the right thing should matter more than just the excitement we feel to live luxurious lives. I personally would enjoy it a lot if I lived in the woods and just lived a simple life.

The last sentence of your comment was of particular interest to me. I agree that people, especially in today's society tend to overwork themselves in order to obtain a competitive and respectable material value. In regards to this type of race of consumerism we were born into, I completely understand why most people in society work tirelessly to obtain unnecessarily large material objects because that is just the standard of what successful work should equate to. To be honest, I'm not quite sure how to reverse this psychological drive for bigger and better material things other than completely creating a change in American culture like Professor Ken often alludes to. Unfortunately, simply shifting the way that 300 million people consume things overnight is not such a simple task. I too think that it's in a way sad that we have been conditioned to work and work in order to purchase the bigger and newer toys society has to offer, when in reality humans can survive on such little amounts of food, shelter, and clothing. I know I will definitely be trying to incorporate more aspects of minimalism into my life not just for the environment for the psychological benefits as well. I mean who wouldn't be happier if they had to work significantly less, yet have the same quality of life? The fact that Thoreau was already criticizing consumerism in the 1800s is rather astonishing to me and I can only imagine the implosion his brain would have if he saw the way in which Americans lived such a fast paced lifestyle today in 2020.

This read was definitely tough, but the part that stuck out to me the most was how Thoreau described building a home from scratch on his own and how cheap it was. I thought that was really bizarre disconnected from today because of how our capitalist society functions. We hire people to build our houses and with specific customizations, it’s usually the well off wanting to create their dream home and not a small shack. I didn’t think this was a realistic message to convey.
     <br><br>

However, after more interpretation, Thoreau is advising for simplicity because of all the waste in the world and how simplicity can bring more authentic happiness. As you pointed out, people need to work more to own more when in actuality, the only necessities in life are clothing, food, fuel, and shelter. His discussion of shelter, which you can probably tell from my first paragraph, stuck out to me the most. Sometimes big homes are simply a symbol of unnecessary riches and nothing more than that. To work more simply to maintain what you don’t need is a sad cycle where there is no winning.
     <br><br>

I think true happiness can be achieved if what you own fits what you want and need. Touching upon the film we watched this week, there were families that practiced minimalism. It came with compromise. Apartments and tiny homes are the most ideal, but because there were couples with children, they wanted and needed houses. With the surplus of people on this earth, compromise is a less radical solution that can bring more of the population together to act over failing to convince everyone to completely convert. We cannot realistically have everyone adopt Thoreau’s life baking his own bread and building his home in the woods from scratch, but implementing minimalist ideas, considering a living space that accommodates the household and donating excess clothing and material. I believe a worldwide movement of everyone, to different extent, taking action is much more effective than extremists doing all they can and losing touch with the rest of the world. Compromise is what leads to others others adopting the ideology simplification over luxury can lead to happiness and understanding how toxic consumerism can be.
<br><hr>
Hi! I really like how you responded to this reading. I found it really interesting to see how Thoreau describes the necessities of life, they are all very simple. But like you said most people are choosing to live their life opposite of this. The fact that Thoreau is describing the positives of living life in a simple way to ultimately get the most out of it is exactly what minimalists are doing today. I find it interesting that this concept has been thought about for so long because if someone came up to me and asked me when the concept of minimalism started I would have said in the last few years. After reading this it is clear that Thoreau’s ideas were very similar to those of minimalist making him like Ken said the Grandfather to the idea.
<br><hr>
I feel that Thoreau's "Walden" is a timeless piece.  He explains how back in the 1800's, people worked hard in order to be able to afford luxuries.  This can 100% be seen in today's America (and other parts of the world.) Our society places such a high regard on working ourselves until we can't anymore just to be able to afford the bare necessities.  Like katluti stated above me, it is difficult to picture being able to build your own home in such a cheap way. In fact, many people in our generation cannot even buy a home, much less build one from scratch. As many of you have stated, its psychologically ingrained into us to buy things in order to measure our worth, and that it will take time to convince people that minimalism is not only cheaper, but a wiser way to live.

<br><hr>
I agree with you as well as Thoreau that living a simplified lifestyle is one that everyone needs to turn to because it is an environmentally better way to live than some previous generations before ours. When you mention that Thoreau said “people work more in order to own more”, I slightly disagree with that because many people in the United States are living off of lower-income jobs but working a lot to keep just the basic necessities that they have. I feel that in order for us as a country to start living more simplified lives we need to start implementing a carbon tax and making certain environmental things more affordable and accessible like housing, green transportation like eco-friendly buses and trains, and renewable energy to power our homes. If and when the country is able to do that I fully believe my generation could follow in Thoreau’s footsteps and live a more simplified life, minus the isolation and proximity to the wilderness. Even though Henry David Thoreau wrote “Walden” in the 1850s his message about living a simplified life because it is better for the environment is still relevant today which is something that shocks me because who knew that a piece of literature that was written over 160 years ago could be used as a guide for how people can live today in modern times.
<br><hr>
I completely agree that people tend to work just so they can achieve what their neighbors have, even if that leaves them unfulfilled. Thoreau discusses how those who are wise live simple lives and I think that this idea still applies today. Luxury items often make people unhappy and they destroy relationships, causing unnecessary clutter and anxiety. Thoreau’s voice, while a tough read, seems to be timeless. As a society that feeds off of consumerism, we are only harming ourselves and the planet. Thoreau also comments on how wasteful people are with clothing, material goods, and housing. We see this today as well, as people prioritize items over individuals. This is the root of the climate change crisis and why so many people are unhappy in the world today. 
      <br><br>

While this book is centered on the idea that living a minimalistic life in the woods is a good idea, this is not very practical for today’s society. I believe we can still take the wisdom of Thoreau and apply it to how we chose to live our lives, from buying less to living in a smaller house. His comment that we work so hard all our lives to relax only during such a short period in our life really struck me. I often find myself working hard constantly, always focused on the next thing I need to accomplish. This served as a reminder to me to slow down and appreciate what I have. Living our lives for subsistence and happiness is better than constantly wanting more. This chapter has motivated me to make a difference in my life and see how it affects my outlook and attitude.

<br><hr>
The simplicity of the lifestyle that Thoreau describes in "Walden" was rather comforting to read about. Not having to worry about hefty bills and unnecessary stress of consumerism. The lifestyle that so many people choose to live now requires so much more work, time, and effort than is really needed to lead a satisfactory life. I also found that statement in the piece to be very thought-provoking: "Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind."  Imagine if we spent all the extra time that we devote towards being able to afford larger homes and fancier cars toward engaging in more rewarding hobbies and activities. I find the aspect of working less and being more environmentally-minded to be a very compelling reason for living a more simplified, minimalistic life.

<br><hr>
I agree with you that many times people overextend themselves because they try to compete with their neighbors in terms of materialistic objects. We often do not reflect within ourselves and question our own qualities. As soon as we are born we are put into a position that those that are the most praised are those with the most money and the flashiest possessions. We do not choose to look beyond that and analyze the quality of our life. Like Thoreau mentioned in "Walden", "The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost". We work and toil, but never question the purpose of our actions. It was an eye opener to find out that the yearning for a simpler life was already present in the mid 1800s. If this change had started earlier the societal standards we hold now would have completely changed and would have catered to the well being of humans rather than the lavish lifestyle that we are pushed to strive for. With the standards that are in place we continue to destroy the remainder of the preserved land and continue to harm each other and the Earth.
<br><hr>
I agree with your comment. It's a bad loop our society has enacted within us that forces us to constantly work for things we don't need aside from allowing us to compete with everyone around us. But that truly isn't necessary. And I also feel like this constant pressure is completely internalized. I, for one, as I imagine many others too, don't give a rat's ass if you're wearing thrifted clothes or the same 10 articles of clothing throughout the week (I may be saying this too because I'm doing that because I am BROKE and I like my 10 articles of clothing quite a lot) but even if I were richer, with a larger closet, who still am I to look down on someone not conforming to my specific lifestyle? Especially if mine were to be extravagant and wasteful and entirely unnecessary.
      <br><br>
But back to the loop. Breaking the cycle is so much better for the environment, I firmly agree with that. It's a win win situation, work less, Earth is less impacted. More time to enjoy the things our soul actually enjoys, beyond the basic concept of materialism.


<br><hr>

I agree with your comment, while this was a tough read for me too, the connections that Thoreau made really demonstrate the complete opposite of what we see in our society today. While Thoreau mentions the important of simplicity and how we can truly live a better and more positive life though that, our society praises materialism. Capitalistic ideals push the idea that the things we have and our wealth will equate to happiness, when that is not true. Thoreau brings everything back to the basics and reminds us of the real necessities. Additionally, he talks about the system we are in, where we have to work more in order to keep up with our materialistic lifestyle. This reminded me of the lecture as well. Where Ken mentioned that we think that being able to have a car is seen as a sign of freedom, but that if we could have more time off of work because we would not have to have the money to afford a car, that would be a better sign of freedom.
<br><hr>
I agree, we spend most of our lives working really hard to achieve a lifestyle that we see others living. We are always  wanting more and more. This desire to constantly improve our lives is good to a certain extent, I think. However, at a  certain point, we become more wealthy than is "comfortable" and that is the issue. I think if people who live a "comfortable" lifestyle should be content. If people were more content with what they have and less focused on what they don't they would be happier.
<br><hr>
While reading the article, I saw so many instances in which Thoreau described a life that was much better than ours. In the life that was described, you would be able to live without working as hard as you do now to try and enjoy the things that you don't yet have. A quote that really struck me was "He has no time to be anything but a machine". When reading into this quote, I realize that even if we are working for all these things that we think we need, the only thing that we will be doing is working. We won't be able to enjoy anything because we have no time to. We would be stuck in an endless cycle in which we work for the things we want, we get what we want, and then we see something else we want and continue to work for it. The more that we work for it, the less time that we will have to actually enjoy it. Thoreau shows us that we would live a much more enjoyable life by living life as minimally as possible through the things we do. We don't need the lavish styles that others may have. Living the lavish lifestyles that have been impressed on us since birth is something that we need to control in order to benefit the earth. I completely agree with the fact that living a more simplified lifestyle would be environmentally better for the earth and it would take less out of us regarding labor.
<br><hr>
I would agree, that living a simpler, more straightforward and unelaborate lifestyle would contribute to decreasing your environmental impact, as the people around the world who live the simplest lifestyles, also tend to have the lowest carbon footprint. However, I think there is something to be said about how countries who are able to maintain a high standard of living (ie. Education, healthcare, income, etc.) rely upon a more complex system of living. The statement that the comforts of life are somewhat hindrances to development or “the elevation of mankind” I find to be incredibly backwards-thinking, and don’t contribute to the challenge of sustainable development. I think it is pretty undeniable that with development comes access to many things that are important and life-sustaining, and the idea that becoming “simpler” with fix our problems, doesn’t take into account our systemic resources and social nature.
<br><hr>
Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden” really conveys the competitive consumer culture of the U.S. “Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have.” This is a quote that really conveys the idea of the blind competition over material items because of the culture that makes one feel like they cannot lose to their neighbors in terms of material goods. Thus, Thoreau’s idea that a simple lifestyle would be better is very understandable. Not only would a simpler lifestyle require less work, it would be better for the environment, and it would remove the stresses of competing over meaningless material goods. Another thing is that a simpler lifestyle could potentially bring more real happiness as the consumer competition culture does not seem to bring happiness as people blindly compete over something that is meaningless in the end. Overall, I would agree with Thoreau that the only necessities we really need in this life are basic clothing, food, fuel and shelter.

<br><hr>
It is crazy to think about how many Americans overwork themselves for monetary gain when they can live a much simpler (and happier) life. And why? To buy a bigger house or more luxurious car? I find these people are chasing an illusion, a construct of what they believe is a "successful" life. Instead of simply enjoying and appreciating all that they have, many people look to the future for fulfillment with their next big purchase or achievement. Thoreau writes "I also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and have thus forged their own golden or silver fetters." Wow. This is an amazing few lines, as Thoreau shows how the wealthy - the "high class" that many people aspire to be - actually are in spirit, the "most terribly impoverished class of all" and have tied themselves down in chains with all of the things they own. I find this fascinating, as I know that true wealth in life does not come with stuff. The most amazing moments of my life have come as a result of not having stuff. When I have felt most free, I have been free of the "dross" holding me down like my phone. "The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian, and Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich inward." Let's aim for inward richness instead of outward material richness, then we can live in harmony with each other and the planet.

<br><hr>
Reading Walden made me realize how large and excessive we live. For a long time my biggest goal was to have a big house with a huge backyard. The thought of decorating rooms and buying nice furniture excited me, but after taking this course and especially after reading Walden, I see how destructive our goals can be to the planet. While I definitely don’t imagine myself living so simple like Thoreau, I can say a huge house is no longer something I aspire to have. Instead a much simpler living situation like an apartment sounds much more intriguing. Knowing my carbon footprint will be lower because of how I choose to live makes me happy. We’re surrounded by so much clutter that we don’t need, that I’m sure it would be good for everyone to simplify their lives and be happier with less.

“Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not sometimes to be content with less?”
<br><br>
In our consumerist culture, our success is measured by things like how big our homes are or how expensive our clothes are. His minimalist lifestyle seems very unrealistic now because of how deep that mindset is embedded in our culture. I agreed with his critiques of how people live, where we want “more splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothing”. We hope to achieve all of that just because it’s the norm. Despite that, I did enjoy reading what he thought of a simple lifestyle and examined my own life to see what I could incorporate. I am trying to stop eating meat little by little and found his reasoning for a vegetarian diet interesting. I think that if one lives in a first world country like the US, killing some poor animal like a goat for meals is unnecessary. My family used to do this a lot for parties and killed a goat to make a popular Mexican dish. I do not agree with that and refuse to eat it because here in the US it is not necessary to do that to survive, we have so many other options. 
<br><br>
Even though Henry Thoreau wrote this a long time ago, it still connects and applied to modern western society. Thoreau wrote, people, “are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the coats and shoes which are fast wearing”. That reminded me of how people are going on Instagram or other social media platforms and claiming to be living this life that is fabricated. Most of the time those people were not able to pay for them but the public still buys into it and they wish to obtain that ‘lifestyle’. After listening to Prof. Hiltner's lecture, it is very scary to see that even though it will be environmentally disastrous, many people in our generation will not give up the life scripted for us.

 I agree with you in that He is right in the sense that our consumer culture is disastrous but it is so incredibly rooted inside us where change seems unrealistic. Like you, I was really interested in reading his simplicity life, comparing it to the materialistic world we live in now. And I understand what he means when he says that these objects that fill our lives don't make us happy, as I lay in my comfy bed with plush pillows on my highly expensive laptop... I don't feel sad. Do I need everything I have? No. Yet I'd argue that many things significantly make my life easier/better. Knowing the status of our earth/environment there are changes I would be willing to make and some I have already, But for the rest of America, the majority will most likely not. Most are not going to look at their beautiful 5 bedrooms two-story house and downgrade for the environment. Americans are greedy and they will argue that this is what the "American Dream" is about. While Thoreau's principles about living a simple lifestyle are true in that this minimalistic life will help the environment. But I have yet seen a realistic and plausible way to get the majority of people on board. Because taking away their luxuries doesn't seem flattering in the eye of the beholder.

This week’s reading was very interesting. While I was reading this chapter, there were two quotes that specifically stood out to me. The first quote was that he believes that “most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.” After reading this quote, I started to think about today’s society. As time passes, people are needed more and more new technology to keep themselves satisfied. When will it all be too much? The second quote was “be sure that you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be your example which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend yourself with it, and do not merely abandon it to them.” I loved this quote because it speaks to today’s wealth gap. What is the point of being wealthy when you won’t use your wealth to help others?

<br><br>

Last year, I followed a YouTuber that is known for living a very minimalistic lifestyle. After watching some of his videos, I started incorporating some of the things that he does into my own lifestyle. I tried my best to donate the clothes that I do not wear anymore as well as lessen my carbon footprint by driving everywhere. I did this to better myself and the planet that I inhabit. Like how Ken said, Thoreau stepped out of his regular routine to ponder the sort of life that he considered worth living. This was another reason why I tried incorporating minimalistic mannerisms into my life.

I agree with Thoreau’s main argument that living a simple life can lead to a happier more fulfilling life. While this may be true for many, I do not think it is correct or accurate to generalize this belief to everyone. I think there is beauty in living a simple and modest life. I also think there is beauty in living a life of “luxury” and enjoying the things that make you happy, whether it be expensive, cheap or free. Some people find joy in expensive food, travel, cars, expensive homes etc.… Some people may look at this as materialistic, which it very well might be. If people find joy in things that happen to be expensive, who is anyone to judge them for that? Just because someone enjoys a different lifestyle, does not mean their way of living is inherently wrong. The argument that living a “simple” life will make everyone happier is not true for everyone.
<br><br>
 I do think it is important to cut back on emissions, of course. I do not think that enough people will willingly give up their lifestyles to save the planet unless it is enforced or incentivized in some fashion. Yes, living a simpler life may make some happier and will help the planet to a miniscule degree, it is not true for everyone and likely will not make as much as a difference they think it will. I stand by my belief that the main hope for fighting climate change lies in the hands of the government and or technological advancements. It is also not likely that people can afford to live a “simpler” life. I realize that people will read this and immediately disagree, because they have just finished reading Walden and are inspired to live a simple life to find happiness, but in a week or so, will forget and go back to their normal lifestyle.

It is not wrong to say that the only happy life we can have is not just to live in a simple way like Walden does. I agree with with you said that it is definitely true that we all can have different ways of living our lives and we standard of what is an enjoyable life.
<br><br>


Looking at this modern day, it is hard to make people to cut all their consumptions and go back to life like ages ago. But the convenience that modern technology has brought to us and all the luxurious lifestyles we all have been enjoying for so long is something hard for us to live without.
<br><br>
However, I don’t really agree with you saying the only hope to help with climate change lies in the hands of the government and technological advancement because everyone of us have the responsibility to do something to bring a change to the climate crisis.

<br><br>

I believe Walden’s article is not mainly to ask us to all have the simple life style like he does, but it is a great article to let us all learn about what is the difference of different lifestyles we can live with and his way of doing remind us the style of life we are having right now might cause problems and put burden on our planet and even affecting the health of ourselves. Just make some little changes such as don;t buy too many things that we might not need, save energy, and reduce the amount of carbon emission are things we all can contribute on.

People often ask me why I enjoy backpacking and until now, I never really knew how to correctly respond. However, after reading the first chapter of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden, I realized that I love backpacking because it allows me to temporarily live a simpler life closer to nature. I admire Thoreau for challenging the role he was given at birth and then taking action to live a simple, meaningful life. While I was reading, I kept thinking of what Thoreau would think of the world today and of our current focus on materialism and consumerism. I think he would be dismayed and disappointed. 

<br><br>

I was struck by the quote “Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistakes, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them… [and are]...making [themselves] sick”. This is the unfortunate reality for a large segment of the western population today, where we are seeing a rise in “workaholism”. Workaholism is characterized as working prolonged hours. Working long hours has the potential to significantly impact both the physical and mental health of a worker. The extreme impacts of workaholism are evident in Japan. Recently in Japan, instances of “Karoshi (sudden death caused by cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease due to overwork) and Karojisatsu (suicide due to overwork)” have both become more prevalent. Despite evidence indicating that long working hours can be detrimental, the United States government and corporations continue to encourage long working hours in an attempt to maximize their profits. The United States government should limit the number of hours people work to encourage a plentitude economy (as described in the short film “Visualizing a Plenitude Economy”) with happier, more connected, and more sustainable citizens.

Having read Walden multiple times already, I  was amazed that I found myself in awe of the genius of Henry David Thoreau. His comments on the American people and his critiques of the American lifestyle seem almost prophetic when contextualized with the issues we currently face. For example, his mockery of the fashion industry calling the fashion industry leaders "head monkeys in Paris which the monkeys in America follow" has worsened exponentially from his time. However, his proposals for a simpler life may not be entirely environmental. As we will learn in the film Minimalism, there is a plethora of benefits that come from adopting a more minimal, streamlined lifestyle. In fact these changes can be so great as to even cure depression, and send your happiness levels through the roof. So, David Thoreau's criticism can also be coming from a general wellness perspective, not simply one of environmental catastrophe prediction. The American dream idealizes consumerism, which shallows a person's soul, leaving them a materialistic shell of a person. Walden, while definitely an environmentalist, was also likely concerned for the health of the nation as well. So, should we subscribe to Thoreau's proposals? I believe that my generation should. Until the necessary change is converting to 100% renewable energy use, we must take it upon ourselves to mitigate the effects we will experience in this episode of climate change.

I too believe that living a non-materialistic life would be for the better but it would be the same as getting over an addiction. From childhood, we look forward to receiving gifts whether it is for our birthdays or from Santa for Christmas. It is on TV, Billboards, magazines, and even books the presence of "cool things" is everywhere so it's hard to forget about them. Nevertheless being in college has ultimately taught me to not want an excess of objects due to lack of space and the need to move it in the future.

When I was reading Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” I am surprised that the insight from his book in the nineteenth century can fit perfectly in today’s society. He mentioned the term consumerism, and its negative impact on the environment. As Ken has mentioned in the video, the fact about luxuries today is the unlimited desire about fashion or the invisible competition with the thrive of social media. I am surprised when I saw the comment in the Kim Kardashian’s video that many people like her or her pattern of spending money. We have more desires on what we do not actually need, like fashion clothes and big houses. Although we can live in a small house comfortably and have a lot of reusable clothes, we cannot be satisfied, even through all the luxuries cannot actually make us happy. In fact, we can live like what Henry Thoreau, to live a minimalist life in 1845 and we can be happier.

I also found it interesting that Henry David Thoreau thought consumerism was a problem in the nineteenth century. I can only imagine how displeased he would be with the amount of materialistic things society makes us think we need in the present day. As Ken mentioned in the follow up video, the need for “stuff” has been passed down through generations of Americans. It is time to realize that materialistic things will not make us happy. A lot of people who criticize giving up luxuries for a simpler life, probably haven't tried it. Personally, I try to declutter regularly and each time I do, I realize I have way too much stuff. The simpler my life is the more whole I find myself feeling. In a way, Henry David Thoreau is an environmental activist through his minimalist mindset. Owning less things is environmentally friendly because so much waste and pollution are used to produce products. Living a minimalist lifestyle can be achieved through only getting clothes at thrift stores and growing your own food.


<br><hr>

I agree with your comment. It was quite astonishing trying to read this with a mindset in the nineteenth century, where I already think of people living in a lesser way than Americans do in this century. It was also quite crazy to think of how true it would’ve been then, but how much it coincides with today’s society and our troubles with wanting to live a luxurious life. Thoreau shows us that we don’t need all the luxuries and tangible goodies to make ourselves feel good. We don’t need huge homes, exported clothes and drinks, or expensive foods to make ourselves feel any better either. Consumerism today has exploded and turned so expensive and society has been overwhelmed and conquered by this need to live a good life by spending money. 
<br><br>
By practicing Thoreau’s way of life we can probably be more at peace with ourselves and it’s definitely help knowing that we’re also making a positive impact to the environment.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with what you said regarding Thoreau's insight about living a back to nature lifestyle. In a world where having a bunch of materialistic stuff is the norm, his message about consumerism is definitely relevant to today’s society. We can all take a step back from our current way of life and learn something from him. Rather than buying everything we want or simply because we can, Thoreau shows us that it is possible to live a simplistic life with very few possessions and still be happy. I’d even argue that having less stuff will result in a happier and more fulfilling life. 
<br><br>


I also found it interesting that someone like Thoreau had come across the issue of consumerism, which is still plaguing our society today, as far back as the 19th century. Compared to back then, our lives are more lavish and luxurious, so how is it that he was able to avoid the trap of consumerism that many have fallen for? You’d think that once this problem has been pointed out, people would consume less and learn to simplify their life, even if it is just by a little. However, we did not simplify, but instead we continued to increase our consumption of goods. If Thoreau were to witness what has become of our society, he would definitely be shocked and horrified by how much we are consuming. I believe that he could have never fathomed or expected us to not only be living this sort of lifestyle, but continuing to consume even more with each passing generation.

I personally appreciate this comment of Jiarui's. It's the sad truth that we aren't 100% satisfied until we have obtained materialistic items that we can surely live on without. Realistically, no one really cares about that stuff at the end of the day. It's society and its standards telling us who we need to be in order to be relevant in a world where people like Kim Kardashian are showing off an absurd and unnecessary lifestyle. It is completely unethical of her to be spending loads of money on grand items and massive extravagant birthday parties for her toddlers rather than helping Australia in times like this where over 15 million acres have been burned. Instead, Kim is purchasing more cars beyond her needs, nor does the environment need it. If only Henry David Thoreau witnessed the severity of today's consumerism. Oh the disappointment would undoubtedly be unsettling. We simply aren't born to require more than a bare minimum. More people need to come to that realization.

Thoreau”s lifestyle experiment in "Walden" was considered  a strange and interesting one even at that time. It seems as though having large houses and new, trendy clothes were in back then as well. By doing this experiment Thoreau realized you don’t need all these material objects to be happy with life and what you have. He only had his small living quarters, his few sturdy clothing articles and his crops he ate.

<br><br>

In this modern age we are all obsessed with having the newest pieces of technology, the trendiest clothes we see celebrities wear, and larger homes. According to Thoreau, you can have all these material items and still not be happy. It goes with the saying “money can’t buy happiness”. Kent had said our generation is learning from the one before with their large homes and their very cool items, but our generation is also more informed on the effects of having these items.

I really like how you bring up the idea of buying the newest technologies or trying to flex on everyone in order to be cool. I think that in today’s world, even disregarding the climate or economy, those values should not be the ones that are instilled in the people that are living on this planet today. However, with the rise of social media, and this “I need to look cooler than you” mindset, our world has become ravaged by the markets and suppliers that produce these goods and the people that feel the inherent need to buy them. But, what happens if we don’t? What happens if we do not have the coolest clothes or the newest iPhone or the fastest car? What if we don’t spend our money on trying to impress others or being the “most fly” in the school cafeteria? Well, some would say that they couldn’t live their life if it did not involve the newest things. Others would say that they didn’t need it, but when you present them with that situation, it is apparent that they do indeed need the materials that are not considered essential. 

<br><br>

It is upon our society to determine that. The decision between non-essential and essential is more clouded than ever because our society - not our beliefs - build the lifestyle we think we need. Yet, when we look at our own personal lives - when we can take away the perspective of what other people think our lives should be - and we focus on the things that we actually need to live, then we can get back to solving the problem that currently presents itself: our climate. Our climate has a lot to do with societal perspectives that most people undermine, and once we get to that root issue, we can start to improve combatting our crisis.

I didn’t know what to expect at all when I went into the reading this week however I was pleasantly surprised. Throughout the piece so many parallels between topics that Thoreau brought up are incredibly pertinent and relatable in this day in age. Some maybe and even more so than back when Thoreau wrote the piece. 
 <br><br>

Thoreau wrote about consumerism and shifting back to a simpler way of life. This really resonated with me. Our society today is so driven by consumerism, if a shirt goes out of fashion, we don’t wear it and have to by a new one to meet the standard fashion. Thoreau rallied against the fashion industry multiple times in his piece. One line that really stood out to me was “I believe that all races at some seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt.” To me this was just another example of how our societies and lives have grown over the past thousands of years. In the past clothing was developed to protects us from the cold, heat, insects, and things that affected our well-being. Throughout the years we then developed into a society where it was seen to be unacceptable to wear the same shift two days in a row, or even in the same week for that matter. Shirts, and other clothing items were made for all occasions and seasons, and something as simple as shirt has turned into so much more. Thoreau stated, “But if my jacket and trousers, my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in, they will do; will they not?” This really made me reflect on my own clothing items. “Why do I have so much? What am I using it for? What is the purpose?” I feel as if it is almost a waste to have the items sitting in my closet when they could be being used. 
 <br><br>

Another line that really stood out to me in the piece was “the old have no very important advice to give the young” I thought this was such a great parallel to what we have been discussion in class. The older generation have damaged our planet and is currently refusing to help. Similarly they are instilling expectations in us to have bigger houses, more clothing, and more and more. When in reality we need to do the exact opposite. Thoreau discussing this made me question if the same types of behavior were happening in the 1900s? How do we set the expectations for ourselves and our children to simplify rather than expand?

I think that his quote, "All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be" really captures his view of consumerism that he's trying to express. Afterward, he then elaborates on the idea that there is no point in receiving new suits/clothes if the man himself wearing them still acts in his old, worn ways, similar to "keeping new wine in old bottles." I think this relates to your point about owning excess clothing too. What is the point of owning clothes upon clothes upon even more clothes when only about 50-60% of the ones in your closet get worn? It doesn't really change who you are as a person, just your exterior, right? I'd like to blame this on the need for both owning unnecessary amounts of possessions and increasing your self-image, both of which society has conditioned into us since birth. Sadly, I too also feel the same sentiments as you about the excess clothing I own, even if a large number of them are thrifted/secondhand.
 <br><br>


I agree that it is up to our current generation and (possible) future generations to learn from the destruction of prior generations in order to have a more positive impact on the planet. However, with the influence that the prior generation still has on the world at the moment, as you noted with your line about instilled expectations, how hard will it be to pass on the right mindset with this influence still being somewhat powerful?



<br><hr>
I completely agree with you, everything that Thoreau is advocating for in this book is even more relevant today. I think that if Thoreau saw how we lived in the 21st century, he would be immensely disappointed. If he thought the lifestyle of the people around him was dangerous, he would be incredibly frightened by the way Americans live today. Consumption has grown exceptionally. We eat more food, more meat, wear more clothes, and live in larger houses. 
 <br><br>

The fashion industry has grown and has been responsible for the death of hundreds, and is a large part of our carbon footprint. Today, the average American buys 60 new items of clothing a year, not including socks and underwear. Compared to Thoreau's few item's of clothing this in credibly excessive. 
 <br><br>

Today, fast fashion has surged in popularity, where consumer's are convinced they want 10 low quality clothes that will not last long rather than one high-quality item. This "disposable" fashion trend needs to end if we are looking to save the Earth. We need to normalize repeating outfits up cycling clothes. A tear in a pair of pants can be fixed with a patch, but we are more concerned with our image rather than what's actually impactful.

Thoreau was very ahead of his time, commenting on issues that still dominate society and consumerist culture with unimaginable magnitude. Two of the most notable themes I noticed when reading Walden, are Thoreau’s attitude consumerism which paved the way for modern minimalism, and how he likens the human condition to nature. As Thoreau was a Transcendentalist, nature is of course a central topic in his book, yet he deepens this connection between people and the natural world by stating that human lives must be open to change, just as nature must do the same. We are, after all, just animals who perceive ourselves as superior to the world around us. This connects to climate change because human beings are constantly searching for permanence and consistency, which is the opposite of how the natural environment functions, as it is in a constant state of change. In this quest for permanence, human beings have fabricated this whole society, finding our own sources of energy that don’t comply with the laws of nature and in doing so we are destroying our own home. This was Thoreau’s essential argument in his novel. All of these things that we have been told will make us happy or make us important, don’t really matter. Giving up on societal expectations aka turning to “voluntary poverty,” is the only way to be truly free and one with the natural world. And after all, by practicing minimalism, not only does one experience freedom but this is one of the best things anyone can do to help the environmental crisis at hand.

I loved your comment and your depiction of Thoreau.  I believe he was an incredibly noteworthy figure; like you said, he was truly ahead of his time.  I also agree that Thoreau’s attitude paved the way for the practice of minimalism and the connection between humans and the natural world.  The fact that human beings are inept to accepting change is a huge component of the current climate crisis; humans have taken it upon themselves to create permanence, which is not how the natural world functions.  We have created a facade of the real world (that is, nature) and manufactured a society dependent on material goods and social superiority.  This has left us as a society of unhappy people who continue to act in an environmentally detrimental way.

 <br><br>

Thoreau proposes a drastic change from this, one that has provided a spiritual pathway for many individuals.  He attempts to convey the value of minimalism and living a life for no other purpose than self growth.  Throughout his experiment, he finds that the true cost of living in modern society is a complete loss of one’s self; the only way to be free is to give up everything and truly connect with nature, the universe, and yourself.  The consumer culture is a huge distraction to this endeavour; in a world where we are told that success means owning the newest, flashiest, material goods, we are not prone to seeing the value of spending time away in nature.  However, only in the natural world can we find true purpose and meaning in life, in a place away from all the unnecessary material goods of society.

I remember reading “Walden” last year in English 22, and I have to be honest since that day I haven’t lived life the same. Henry David Thoreau embarked on a years-long minimalist adventure in which he lived in a cabin no larger than a garden shed and turned his back on the consumerist nature of the world. Each morning, he woke up, made food that he had gathered or hunted himself and turned his attention to enjoying the small pleasures of the world. How the leaves swayed in the wind, the sounds of the forest as one woke up from a night’s rest, how the water delicately rippled through a pond or how the stars brightly shone during the night. All of these occurrences are things he began to enjoy and appreciate during his time in the woods. He emphasized a simplistic lifestyle that doesn’t require one to be constantly working, such as farmers. Life to him is a journey that should be enjoyed from start to finish, not consumed with constant work for the purpose of buying “stuff” as Ken puts it because to live like that is to subject oneself to a life of self-made prison.

 <br><br>

Reading it, I could see just how much time we waste and how much we fail to appreciate when we subject ourselves to consumerist ideals. Life does not revolve around “stuff” and this is why I said my life changed when I realized this in English 22 last year. Now, I’m not saying I’m living in a shack on 66 Trigo at the moment, and I won’t even go so far as to say I don’t make the occasional impulse purchase for something I absolutely don’t need. But what I did do and continue to do is appreciate the simplicity of simple living. I have more time in my day to take a walk when I normally might have been playing PlayStation or spend my money on a potted plant rather than on a cool shirt I saw online. Although these are small, I can truly say I’ve been happier for the sole reason that I don’t place worth or value on what consumerist culture deems to be acceptable or necessary. It’s as though I’d been freed from a lifetime of chains and you can be d*mn sure I’m never going back either. This life isn’t for everyone, I completely understand that, but implementing it slowly into your life will definitely have an impact, and whether than impact is positive or negative is up to you.

I share your appreciation for “Walden” because it reminds us of the simple, natural things that exist which can bring such contentment by just enjoying the world for what it is, instead of trying to alter it or be disconnected from it entirely. Even though I believe having so much technology and social media is a huge distraction from really connecting with other living beings and our environment, the internet and instantaneous communication did not exist in the 19th century when Thoreau wrote this, indicating that there has always been people wrapped up in superficial things and concerned about things that do not add value to their lives. I really believe that individuals are different in their pursuits, because we have extremes of those living in recluse and live off the land, and people exist purely for material things and the idea of being respected for the things they own. Everyone has a choice to live in a certain way and I think that those who lean more towards a less materialistic and consumerist lifestyle will generally be happier because there is less reliance on people and things to be happy. Also, I hate the idea that life is just finding jobs to make money to sustain ourselves. If having a good job is the most important thing to obtain in life, then I do not want to live in such a society. I want to be defined by the person I am, how I treat others, what I fight for, and the things that bring me joy, not “Hi I’m Erin and I’m a (insert abstract job title that does not explain who I am or what I care about). We need to move away from asking people what they do as the first question; instead, we need to ask people what their passions are, what gets them out of bed in the morning.
 <br><br>


In terms of possessions, I was so happy to see the show “Tidying Up” with Marie Kondo because it reaffirms the idea that the things we own should bring us joy. It makes a lot of sense to eliminate physical things from our lives that are just sitting in the corner of our rooms and houses for a few reasons. First, I think it would clear up our living spaces to provide a better sight for our eyes. I personally feel better when my house is clean and organized because it gives me a sense that my life is in order. Second, I think the excess stuff that we do not use or care about could always be given to someone or something that could much better appreciate and love, like clothes and other goods that people typically need. All in all, the minimalist lifestyle could help people reassess what actually has meaning in their lives, while redistributing the wealth and goods to people who are less fortunate to make these decisions.


<br><hr>

I also read “Walden” last year in Ken’s English class, and as with you, my mindset changed after reading it. After moving down here to Santa Barbara and living on a budget, I was already forced in some sense to consider what material belongings are actually important and are necessities, and what is simply a waste of money. But after reading this I gained a deeper understanding of how the things I buy and do affect the environment. Having to really consider these things is liberating, and I feel that is how Thoreau felt as well. You just feel better and happier, like you said, with less stuff and when you don’t have that desire to just go buy things. Every purchase means something. As Thoreau says and Ken reiterated, simplicity. I am no shining example of Thoreau’s lifestyle in the slightest; I still live in a large house with other people, I still drive my car everyday, and I still make frivolous purchases on games or entertainment, but after reading this again it has once again made me stop and think about why I am purchasing those things, and why I feel the desire and need to have them.
 <br><br>

Everyone can learn something from reading this. I hope that our consumerist culture eventually shifts to one that takes what they really need, and nothing more. We would improve so much should we all shift our mindset to one more like Thoreau’s. We would undoubtedly become happier, healthier, and care more about our actions and how they affect those around us subconsciously, consciously, and in actuality. I too understand that it may be difficult for people at first, but everyone is capable of doing it to some degree, and if they disagree with that, then they just aren’t being honest with themselves, or they really have not considered their own lifestyle and what is really important to them deep down.

This class, its readings, films, lectures, and the comments I see on these YouTube videos are all inspiring me to make massive lifestyle changes. I would very much like to live a more minimalist lifestyle now. Henry David Thoreau wrote, "Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and meagre life than the poor." I agree that most of the commodities we have in life are unnecessary, flashy, and a hindrance. I believe if we live minimalist lives, we will find peace. We will find inner happiness. Everyone will be better off.

 <br><br>

I agree with you, when you write "life does not revolve around 'stuff'". I too have realized my life is more fulfilling when I spend my time being productive, focused on helping others, establishing relationships with people I meet, etc. I hope everyone can better their lives by learning what Professor Hiltner teaches us in English 22 and 23.


<br><hr>
I agree with you comment about "how much time we waste and how much we fail to appreciate when we subject ourselves to consumerist ideals". I strongly agree with this because I feel that everyone has this notion that sticking to the latest fashion trends and having the best clothing at the moment will make you undeniably happy. I can not even count the number of times a friend told me "I cannot live without that" when referring to an object that was a luxury. Spending all this money on the newest fashion can actually make you less happier because then you have less money to go out with friends and just enjoy yourself. Before taking this class, I was not able to restrict myself on my purchases. If I saw something and everyone else around me had it, then I automatically wanted it too. When taking ENGL 22, I was able to start actually putting thought into my purchases and be able to identify what I actually need and what I just want. Now, if I am to spend my own money, it is mainly going to be for groceries. When I return home, I am always embarrassed to see all of the things that I have accumulated over the years and have barely touched. Over this past break, I have began donating my clothes even though I still have a lot more to give. 
 <br><br>

I like Thoreau's story on his cabin at Walden Pond because it is a true account how having less can actually make you more satisfied with your life. As Ken mentioned in lecture, Thoreau was already a wealthy man and I feel that most of use would think that he already had It all and why would he want to change that. I feel that this makes his argument all the more convincing because many people work hard to achieve a life like Thoreau just to learn that this life is not all that it seems. Doing what Thoreau did, made his life better because he did not have to worry about a lot. When you have a lot you have a lot more to worry about. He did not have to submit to what the common person does to make a living and was still able to make a living with all that he did and was still able to have leisure time.
<br><hr>

I couldn't agree more that these works of art and literature from these two courses have changed how I behave as a person. I find that it is in a bit of a different way though. I am not from a wealthy place, and in a way that made having material items to display wealth even more sought after. Whether it be new shoes, new phones, having a coffee with you in class, etc. these were all things that were constantly being consumed as a way to display wealth. I am not a wealthy person myself, my mother was a waitress and my father worked on the railroad for most of my childhood, I can admit that I too fell into this trap of displays of wealth through objects. However, I had access to nature, unlike many of my peers. I think that camping really shows you what you do and do not need to survive. Once I really made the distinction in my head, I saw these attempts at appearing wealthy for what they were: successful marketing tactics. And I've got to say, when your peers are competing in this way, it was difficult to try to stop. 
 <br><br>
It wasn't until these films and readings that I realized that I could actually be happier without these things that were being used as tools to display wealth. I suddenly realized that the reason I enjoyed camping so much was probably because I could escape the mess of stuff around me that we truly do not need. The Walden reading is enlightening, even though it– and Thoreau himself– have flaws. This is because he so well explains what made living on his own in nature so enjoyable: the blatant lack of societal pressures. I think that I really enjoy living simply, I really felt scattered when I had a lot of stuff. I also find myself living more in the moment, going on walks, owning and propagating house plants, showing my friends and family that they do not need so many things to be happy– and if they do to look for second hand things.

Henry David Thoreau’s book Walden talks about his life embracing the nature by the Walden Pond. According to Thoreau, “most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.” Most people are so focused on things and lose the meaning and purpose of their lives. I have read his book before, and I really do appreciate his work and different approach of life. 

 <br><br>

Thoreau’s idea on age is interesting. He says that “age is no better, hardly so well, qualified for an instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has lost.” Thoreau thinks that the old don’t have very useful advice to offer, and “their own experience has been so partial.” He also illustrates that “one generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels”, which makes me think of the generation gap regarding the climate change issue. This is not to say that I completely agree with Thoreau. In my opinion, since our own experience is limited, we can learn from other people regardless of their generation. Moreover, sometimes we shouldn’t group people based on their generations, because even people within the same generation can be different.

I completely agree with you on both points. I think that so many people are unhappy because they work themselves into exhaustion and even depression chasing after things they think they need, but what will not make them happy. I think the idea of working less and enjoying life more is so appealing, and even though this means you won’t own a gigantic house or three sports cars and 7 expensive watches, you will be able to seize every adventure and opportunity doing things you truly enjoy and spending time with those you love. People in China have literally worked themselves to death, and it is becoming more and more common. I am not sure how to feel about Thoreau's comment about age. On one hand I agree with him, and I think that the generations above us have grossly failed us with their stubbornness, their ignorance, their arrogance, and their unwillingness to change. I think that they did not know what they were doing when it came to consumerism and the consequences it would have, and when they found out they didn’t care and kept on doing it anyway. But I also think that one should not stereotype because there are always people that do not agree with the people the same age as them and much more goes into forming such a complex thing as a human than just their age.

I will admit that I am guilty of the lifestyle Thoreau himself has criticized in “Walden”. I grew up in a home that was much larger than most in my community, my parent’s house is stocked with packaged food that has not been -- and most likely will not be -- touched, and my closet is full of things I have only worn but a few times. However, when reading this article I did not feel offended or defensive in regards to the lifestyle I live. On the contrary, I agreed with most of what Thoreau said in regards to the fashion industry and simplifying in general. In my free time, I watch videos on minimalism and how to live a more meaningful life -- rather than succumbing to the consumerist society we have been socialized into. What Ken said in the video is undoubtedly accurate; from the fashion industry to our very own professions which require certain attire (as Thoreau pointed out), there are materialistic ideologies being pushed upon us from a hundred different directions. It is interesting to imagine how different Thoreau’s reflections would be if written in today’s world. Despite the time discrepancy, his ideas nevertheless remain important today, even moreso now that the climate has warmed largely as a direct result of our society’s consumerist tendencies. I think Thoreau’s challenge is a very helpful way of looking at the idea of simplifying. Myself included, I think Western culture in particular has a way of self-identifying with their belongings, to the point where we have accumulated so much that we don’t even know the entire contents of our own closets. If we reconsider the ways we have been brought up and how much of our supposed necessities are actually necessary, I think people would have a much easier time with reducing the amount of items they buy and reduce their carbon footprint immensely.

I believe that the ideas Walden promotes in his book are even more relevant today than they were when the book was first published. With the threat of climate change increasing, the best way to mitigate its problems will likely have to come from both technological innovation and lifestyle change. The consumer lifestyle of almost every american drives our reliance on fossil fuels and also fuels unlivable working conditions and wages for people all over the world. 
 <br><br>
It seems pretty far fetched to me that people will give up their material belongings that they worked so to obtain in order to solve a problem that seems very distant for most people. I think for this to happen a major revolution against capitalism would have to occur and I really dont see this happening.
 <br><br>
Well see tho.

I have studied Walden and Thoreau’s lifestyle before in a different class, but it is always refreshing to dive back into his theories. I find it fascinating that Thoreau had such radical ideas about a simplistic lifestyle in the 19th century. He probably would have a heart attack if he saw what how we live nowadays. I love his idea, which was also echoed in the film Minimalism, about not having to work because you do not need to pay for so many material goods. I think people get sucked into the trap of selling their lives to a cyclic job, doing something they hate, just so they can afford their cruddy apartment. That is such a backwards way to live. By living with less, one has the opportunity to gain more, and this reading is evident of that. I wish people who lived this way were not ostracized by society. It seems that if anyone were to live this way, we would be utterly shocked and almost disgusted by their choices. We would immediately judge them as crazy or unhappy, while justifying our lives as ‘the right way’. We need to move our attitudes and discourse away from this action, as our language and beliefs about such a lifestyle are the exact thing that has forced us to live in systematic bondage.

I completely agree with you on the fact that it is so interesting to see how the issues that Thoreau saw in his 19th-century society are still very much pertinent in today’s society. As you said, we seem to be living in such a backward society driven by material things that much of society is losing the scope of many issues. I also admire people that are making a conscious decision to live in a tiny home or to find ways to live a true minimalist life. It can be very hard for someone to live this type of life because the American culture emphasizes materialism and makes it so that materialism is the only way to seem successful. Due to this, human greed has shown absolutely no boundary in the last century. Our culture always tells us that bigger is better and it’s hard not to believe because it seems like those that follow that philosophy are always happy and successful. I think we need to make a cultural change in order to encourage people to be minimalistic and realize how useless most of their material things are. If we are not able to make this cultural change, history will repeat itself for the upcoming generation as well.

I think Henry David Thoreau would be appalled to see our 21st century consumer world. Although Thoreau wasn’t always the perfect model for living a minimalist and quaint lifestyle as a result of his family’s wealth and his Harvard education, he did send an important message during his two year hiatus out into Walden Pond. Thoreau made an extreme point to not only those people back in the 19th century who were becoming consumed by things and stuff, but also people who currently live in the world of things and stuff. I thought a key point Ken mentioned in his introduction video was how each generation is almost born to play a role or fulfill a script that was already spelled out for us. This is an apparent problem today that although wasn’t as bad as it was for Ken’s generation, it is still a problem. People are still focused on status symbols, everything from how big your house is to what kind of car you drive. It’s clear to see that these things have taken over our lives in a negative way. Why do we care so much about these status symbols and material things? Because it has been scripted for us by our parents and their parents and their parents’ parents. It’s not their fault, they’re simply following the lifestyle that they were told was a successful one, one that would make them happy and achieve great things in life.
 <br><br>

 I think Thoreau is trying to prove the exact opposite in this opening chapter of his book, that you don’t need a rich, luxurious, stylish life with lots of material things to be content or live a good life. He mentions the specifics of building his house, from how he obtained his wood to keeping specific financial records of how much money he has spent building it. One line that struck me was when Thoreau mentions college life and how students and young people know nothing of real life, saying “I think it would be better for the students… to lay the foundations themselves. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living?”(Thoreau, 29). Here Thoreau is saying that the students who go to such colleges that burden the community should build the college themselves, which would give them a better understanding of the hardship and reality of life. I somewhat agree with this point, as most people especially today live in an online world of social media, where they never have to leave the comfort of their homes for any reason. I find this somewhat ironic especially because Thoreau was the student who didn’t know the realities of life, the guy whose family is rich and who went to a private ivy-league college. He does however make the convincing point that living an earnest, simple life is even more fulfilling than leading the life of someone you were supposed to be.

One of my favorite lines from this chapter of Thoreau’s “Walden” is as follows: “So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of change. This is the only way, we say; but there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre.” This exemplifies an idea that Ken presented in previous lectures, one in which people recoil from change, and plays into the idea of societal roles Thoreau describes. Once we are born, by no fault of our own, into a predetermined position. All of us in this class have followed that script fairly well; we went to school, studied, and did well enough to be accepted into this University. Why would we all do this? I believe it is because we’ve been taught that the path to success in linear beginning with education, higher education, a career, a family, and a stable retirement fund. 
 <br><br>

I think that by following this track, we are unlikely to cause major disruptive change. For instance, Greta Thunberg has overcome societal expectations by school striking for the planet. Should we all be doing this? I don’t think I have the answer to that. However, massive efforts on such a large scale would surely do something.
 <br><br>

On the topic of change, as Ken repeatedly mentions, it is truly up to our generation and the ones after us; we have not yet been completely absorbed by the flow of society, haven’t yet invested enough of our lives into one lifestyle or ideology (see Ryan Stiskin’s comment on the Sunk Cost Fallacy in Week 2), and haven’t established a position for ourselves in society yet, as many of the older generations feel they have. We have the brilliant capacity and potential for change. 
 <br><br>

In response to Thoreau, I agree with his simplistic lifestyle approach; personally speaking, my ideal future residence resembles something only slightly more modern than the Walden pond storage box, though equally simplistic, solitary, and subsequently sustainable. Thoreau extensively covers shelter, food, and clothing; each category is not far out of reach. As many of you, my classmates, have mentioned, recent readings and films highlight the issue and don’t present any solutions. However, why should we wait for someone to tell us the answers when we can find them ourselves? We don’t have to wait for the next line in our metaphorical script to take action. It’s certainly not impossible and small actions do matter; for instance, a housing solution could be using high efficiency light bulbs or choosing a smaller residence next time you move (tiny houses!). We’re all familiar with food changes, such as reducing meat intake and shopping locally and seasonally. Lastly, clothing can be upcycled, borrowed, thrifted, and repurposed; it doesn’t have to go to waste, nor does it need to be bought new and with such frequency.
 <br><br>

As a species, we certainly do not need any more things; in some areas, we’ve far exceeded the necessities for survival. Our “consumerist culture” is abhorring, and if Thoreau were able to experience it himself, would likely agree; “Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.”

I really agree with this comment, especially the fact that our generation is in the exact right position to make these changes. A lot of the older generations have had their jobs, lived in the same (large) house, and are used to the life they live now, in line with the status quo. But we’re about to graduate college, start applying for longer-term jobs, move to new places, and start our lives. It’s still easier for us to choose small apartments in cities with good public transportation, or maybe tiny houses where we’re self-sustainable. 
 <br><br>

I also really like the sentiment of us not waiting to be told what to do. It’s completely true that most of us are aware of a lot of the solutions, but we just aren’t taking the steps because it’s easier not to. And I get it. It’s hard to make changes by yourself. So recruit a friend and discuss how to make changes! Or join a group on campus to find like-minded people. There are a lot of really cool environmental activist organizations on campus like the Sunrise Movement, CALPIRG, EcoVista, etc. that collect people together who want to create change.
 <br><br>

Minimalism is definitely something that I think a lot of us are drawn towards, when it keeps becoming more clear that the accumulation of stuff isn’t going to make us happy in the long-term. Thoreau gets that and shows us how society twists the meaning of life purpose and that simplicity is key. It’s kind of romantic reading his work because it shows how life could be. I definitely don’t know if I agree with everything he said, but I do like the minimalist aspect and the idea that we shouldn’t only focus on working. If Thoreau could see us now, he’d definitely be disappointed. Imagine comparing the materialistic life of 1854 to 2020, when consumerism is at an all-time high and people are buying more disposable, short-lasting products than before. Plastic didn’t even exist in 1854. Hopefully, we can learn from past mistakes and make choices for simpler belongings and richer lives.


<br><hr>
What’s most interesting to me about your comment is that you pointed out that “all of us in this class have followed that script fairly well…” I’d like to think that most people attending university are the ones to sow the seeds of change, and while this can easily be true, I think that many of us have found ourselves here because we have followed this linear path to success as you described. Some of us will go on to unsettle Thoreau’s idea of societal norms, but the sad thing is is that many of us won’t because we will wait for others around us to “start today… and it might be a long time before they get off.” This has always been a characteristic of human behavior, from Thoreau’s time to the present, and it seems there has always been a cry for the few people that demand change to come out and lead everyone else. This is very relevant today because it only takes a few people to push a minimalist lifestyle until it is more normal, or to continually drive environmental awareness until it is taken seriously. If anything, the steps taken today may not be fruitful until generations later. This is evident with Thoreau… he presented a simple lifestyle to combat consumerism and still today we have not grasped onto it and have transformed into a hyper-consumerist society.

Even though what Thoreau did was considered as simple, it matched ways that people are capable of changing the situation of the climate crisis. Such as being a vegetarian, living in a simple house, they all satisfied what we learned about five things we can do. These actions were considered as old fashioned at that time, but it actually has an advantage for the climate.  I believe if someone wears used clothes now, others will consider it strange, but we can just buy fewer clothes, which is also a contribution to the environment.

I agree with what you  said. After reading this complicated text, I’m able to extract some of the main points of the book. Which are it’s important for us to live sustainably, not to waste resources, wanting more, just have enough to live. This ties back to what Professor Hiltner said in class about why we equate consumerism with happiness. Does our materialistics need make us more happy? It’s the way our society has structured, those who have more money, can spend more and it’s extremely difficult to get the mindset off. It’s a challenging task to make everyone realize they can live with much less materials to be happy. I personally I’m trying and will live more sustainably, only buy what I really need.

I agree with David Thoreau's belief in a minimalist lifestyle. People are so caught up trying to impress people or just fit into the trends that we get lost in what's really important to us. Compared to being high school, college has taught me to live a much more simple life and I have found joy in that. I use to always want to have nice clothes, get expensive food, and buy things that were not necessary for my life. For example, this is my second year and I am living in a triple because I am forced financially but I do not regret making that decision. It's saving me at least 300 dollars compared to living in the dorms. I also do not have a meal plan because it's so much more expensive compared to making food. Reflecting on this, it has made me save money and I find that I am not stressed. I feel like the environment I'm in has forced us to do that. We go to such an expensive school that it has made us limit the certain things we wanna buy and unlike high school you are not surrounded by people you have to impress for. I feel we are at an age in our life that we do need to care about comparing ourselves to one another. Living a minimalist life could help so many people to realize the simplicity in life and focus on themselves. Implementing this lifestyle will reflect on us when we have a job and have a family. In Ken's video, he mentions implementing vegetarianism into our lifestyle and cutting off imported goods as the human should do for the better but it's such worldwide phenomenon that it's too difficult to do. I generally eat chicken because it's cheaper and better for you but I enjoy all kinds of other meats and people around the world feel the same. I wish we could live in a world that laws and regulates the meats we can eat and shift into plant-based foods.

Thoreau's observations and reflections on humankind implicate that the problems we face today are not wholly new problems. Yes, the issues of the present are different in the past in many ways, often more complex. However, it seems that they are all rooted in the same basic human behavior flaws that we've exhibited for countless generations - selfishness, materialism, arrogance, anthropocentrism, competition, etc - all of which were compounded by Capitalism. Although this was written in the 1850s, which to us seems like forever ago, many of the critiques he makes of human society still hold true today. This is notable in the obsession with fashion, which was already a huge problem at that time. He talks about fashion as an extension of our incessant desire for luxury and excess, which he claims is the antithesis of how we should be living in order to live a virtuous, sustainable, and healthy lifestyle. I was moved by his statement, "beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer of clothes." Thoreau sheds light on this flaw of humans to address their problems and sidestep genuine growth and progress by adorning themselves with new dress and appearances. Rather than wearing better versions of ourselves, we wear new coats.

 <br><br>

"The farmer is endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a formula more complicated than the problem itself"
 <br><br>
This passage hit me so hard. In one sentence, Thoreau nails down the basic premise of our inability to address the crises of humanity. We are attempting to solve our problems by creating elaborate solutions that don't address the roots of our problems. We pitch these elaborate technological and innovative solutions to combat climate change rather than accepting the much simpler solution of halting the flawed economic model that caused it in the first place. We construct massive infrastructural projects to protect coastal development from storms and rising sea level rather than accepting that we should have never built there in the first place. All of this just to continue to be able to live the same detrimental lifestyles we've been living with the justification that we're at least doing something. We're frantically suturing our bulletholes closed rather than letting go of the gun with which we are shooting ourselves.

Walden’s first chapter is the narrator describing living his life as a minimalist for 2 years at Walden Pond for two years. Thoerau describes the essentials for life that are necessary to survive, and they include things such as food, water, fuel, clothing, and shelter. These are the only essentials to life, and anything else is unnecessary. Thoreau is describing a minimalist lifestyle and is advocating for one. 
 <br><br>
Despite being published 166 years ago, this state of mind is still relevant in this day and age. Our materialistic ambitions are a significant portion of the contribution to the climate crisis. Things such as luxury gas guzzling cars, fashion items we don’t need, food waste, etc. are all things that contribute to climate change. I’m sure that the intended reason that Ken assigned this reading in particular is to advocate a minimalist lifestyle that will make a significant impact against climate change. However, it’s hard to stop many of these things, especially considering the times we’re in. Most people can’t even begin the morning until they’ve had their coffee (which Thoreau speaks against), most people drive cars to work so that they can afford that car, their homes, buy clothes and other lavish luxuries that highly impact the climate crisis. I understand that living a minimalist lifestyle such as Thoreau can be the most that people can do directly for the climate crisis considering the stance that most politicians are taking on the matter. But the problem is that it is very difficult to convince people to do so. While living a minimalist lifestyle is the best thing we as individuals can do for climate change, I unfortunately find it hard to believe that enough people will be willing to live as a minimalist to make a significant impact.

I also agree heavily with the idea that our materialistic ambitions are contributing to the current anthropogenic climate crisis. Thoreau gives a pretty satisfying quote for this, with it stating, "the country is not yet adapted to human culture, and we are still forced to cut our spiritual bread far thinner than our forefathers did their wheaten." The earth (country) wasn't made for the type of costly and destructive lifestyle that we are accustomed to today. The fact that Thoreau expressed this in Walden back in the 19th century only made me realize how much more harmful our actions are today, especially with the technological advances and such that we have now.

 <br><br>

I also share the pessimistic view of yours, as sad enough as it is. In today's society, people are so conditioned to living with excess everything, whether it be clothing, the square footage and lavishness of their homes, the possessions within their homes, etc. After telling people for centuries that more is better/desirable, how can we expect these same people to suddenly abandon that mindset and live in the confines of minimalism? I feel like we would need to employ the anti-smoking advertising technique to express the dangers of our current lifestyles, and even then I feel like it wouldn't have a large enough impact to make a difference.

Even as someone who had never read Thoreau before, I was left very interested by his views on simplicity and living a more simplistic lifestyle. Although “Walden” was written with a19th century lifestyle in the mind of Thoreau, I felt that many of his points could be applied to simplify our modern lives. For example, Thoreau states in Chapter 1 that "the luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot." Here I believe he is referring to the fact that many people do not stop when they have the necessities of life, expressed by Thoreau as warmth, but rather must have all the riches and material items that they can, even if this leaves them  “unnaturally” comfortable. I see this idea in our world often, as it seems people cannot be satisfied by living life in a simple matter, and are drawn to the luxury of fancy cars, big homes and a reliance on fossil fuels for unnecessary pursuits.

 <br><br>

In response to Ken’s questioning of how Thoreau would see our 21st century world, I believe he  would be very disappointed by the consumerist culture that we've created. Thoreau seems to tie many of the things he sees occurring in society to be that of human nature, such as when he states “All men want, not something to do with, but something to do, or rather something to be.” Thoreau is basically trying to say that most people want to do what they want to do, and they want to be what they want to be, and not just to seem this way in appearance only. For example, If someone wanted to be a baseball player, he would not just want to dress like one, but actually play in real baseball games. This is why I believe Thoreau would be disappointed with today’s culture, as it seems that our extreme fascination with appearance and the way things seem to be has blinded us from our purpose, or what we actually want to do and be. I think Thoreau would be saddened by the inability of people today to truly know themselves and their own desires, as they are only able to see the trends and roles that others set for them.

As this was not my first time reading “Walden,” I already knew of Thoreau’s attempt at minimalism and desire for transcendence, but in reading it this time around, I appreciated seeing the text in a new light of modern environmentalism. I agree with you that much of his writing can be applied to today’s society; in particular, Thoreau’s reference of fire morphing from luxury into a “present necessity” felt like a perfect parallel to much of today’s consumeristic culture. In countries with a higher standard of living, luxuries seem to turn into necessities, as more people become dissatisfied with a simpler lifestyle of fewer material possessions. This luxurious lifestyle full of materialism is idealized in society, often making people feel as if a simple or minimalist lifestyle isn’t “enough,” and that luxuries are proof of a happy and successful life. Through Thoreau’s experience at Walden Pond, he proves that this is not the case; as he isolates himself from the outside world and gains a stronger appreciation for the natural world around him, Thoreau has the ability to reflect on the toxicity of human society and the damages of consumerism.
 <br><br>

I also agree that that Thoreau would be disappointed in today’s consumerist culture, as many of the problems that Thoreau had with his society have gotten worse. Today, individualism is weak in the face of society and many people struggle to separate themselves from the current corporate lifestyle. Our culture of maximalism puts immense pressure on people to follow the path they’re “supposed to” be on, and in that, a minimalist lifestyle may seem impossible.

The reading, “Chapter 1 of Henry David Thoreau’s 1854 classic Walden.”,  primarily focus was to emphasize a simplistic lifestyle and not to focus on materialistic things.Walden emphasizes how knowledge is a key role of life when he states, “To know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know, that is true knowledge." This grabbed my attention that we should be true to ourselves with what knowledge we have and be okay with what we lack. No one is perfect, but we are all unique in our own way. In addition, Thoreau emphasizes how we are also selfish with ourselves with not being content with what we don't have but also not being happy with our materialistic things. There are many more things that are valuable in life and we shouldn’t lose your happiness for the pursuit of more. We should just be happy with what we have and not overdue the act of getting more clothes or getting more food just to store. We should get things that we dearly need and use. This reading allowed me get a better understanding how it is possible to have a simple successful life.

Agree. In the first Chapter of Henry David Thoreau’s 1854 classic Walden, it mainly talks about why and how people need to live a simpler life. The topic is intimately associated with materialism, which refers to a normal social circumstances that people pursue and request more than they actually need and consume product and services in order to satisfy their inner desire. Thoreau points out the major issue between luxuries and people’s necessities of life.

"None of the brute creation requires more than food and shelter." When I first read this, I immediately disagreed, but I wondered whether it was because I actually believed it was factually false, or because the surrounding consumerist culture that influenced me to perceive that statement as false.
 <br><br>
I remember first reading Henry David Thoreau's "Walden" last quarter in English 22, and back then I only read it more in the scope of environmental literature, and never really took the work as something we can all learn to better fight the climate crisis. After reading it this time, I realized that Thoreau truly understood the importance of living a simpler life without the presence of consumerism.
 <br><br>
In "Walden," Thoreau's argument throughout the chapter is very direct; mankind is always involved in labor in this "comparatively free country," and due to this, they end up ignoring the more meaningful and valuable aspects of life, such as building relations with other people. Thoreau explains that the main cause for this is because men tend to choose the common mode of living, which is constantly being involved in labor, because they believe there are no other choices available. Furthermore, many of the luxuries and the "so-called comforts" of life, which spur consumerism, are hindrances to the elevation of mankind; these excess possessions also require excess labor and bring spiritual oppression with worry and constraint, according to Thoreau. He heavily criticizes this common lifestyle that men live, stating that we need to spend more time caring about ourselves instead of waiving it away for something else. Additionally, he encourages us to break the different stereotypes and prejudice in our society, and that even when the elderly claim that some feats are impossible, we cannot be deterred from doing those very feats. 
 <br><br>
Ultimately, Thoreau compares prisoners to farmers; just how prisoners are chained in jail, farmers are also chained to their farms. Because people just naturally desire and want many products, they end up laboring themselves and lose their freedom and identity to labor. He states that learning to minimize's one needs and wants is best, as many wise people actually lived poor and meager lives compared to the fools. Although he lived in Walden Pond for only a mere two years and two months, Thoreau underscores the benefits of a simplified lifestyle. In relation to the climate crisis, although Thoreau is proposing quite a bit of radical changes to our lifestyle, it is important to understand how vital minimalism is, and how we can adapt to some of Thoreau's changes for the sake of our planet.

I agree people are told from even young age to work hard so that they can live a happy life. We are always told to get a good job which will allow us the income to buy possessions and to own property of our own, thus leading a happy life. Yet most people spend most of their lives focused only on work in order to obtain those possessions because society has taught them that is what success looks like and that will make them "happy". Yet do to that we let life pass us by and in the process we hurt our environment  because we produce a lot of waste from things we did not really want in the first place such as a shirt we got on an impulse, or getting a extra large because of a small price difference from that of a medium.


<br><hr>
I find it surprising that you too, at the beginning, found yourself disagreeing with some of his statements. I agree that this does come from our surrounding consumerist culture! Great point! 
 <br><br>
Our society has been taken over by consumerism and involvement in labor which, as you mentioned, has led us to ignore the more meaningful and valuable aspects of life. I think the urge to have more than what we need has a great influence on the way we choose to live. With the urge to obtain our “wants”, people often feed into the involvement of labor and at times find themselves in debt. Our country is merely focused on economic prosperity and I find that to be the reason why we might be find it difficult to adapt to a simplified way of living.
<br><hr>
True, I absolutely agree to this; it seems like sometimes, the "American Dream" or other ideal futures gives us a perception that we need to earn a ton of money to buy all these materials and products, like the latest iPhone, or the biggest mansion. I also like how you mentioned the point of the negative influence society brings to our decision making when buying products; I know that personally, when a lot of people start buying a certain item (like a clothing brand), I immediately have an instinct to try buying it even when I shouldn't. It really is unfortunate that people continue to fall in this trap where they are constantly opening and emptying their wallets for purchases that have no realistic benefit in the long run.

<br><hr>
 I agree; I also do believe that because of societal influences, people become incentivized to buy all these products and goods, and they end up immersing themselves into labor (as Thoreau mentions). As the amount of labor builds up, you're essentially only destroying your own personal well-being and your relationships with others. So in a sense, although it is true that you can utilize money to buy items that bring you temporary "happiness," such as the latest technological devices, it ultimately ruins your well-being and the way you interact with others.

It’s easy to find that this week’s assignment topic is minimalism. I didn’t find out that this article was written in 1800s until I was browsing all the comments down the video after finishing the reading. The living concept was so close to what we wanted to be today. Minimalist style, as the author’s primary concern in the article, has been popular for a while in today’s society. Actually, in the beginning of the article, the statement and metaphor makes no sense to me. He compared a man who inherited farms and all the livestocks to serfs who forever constricted to several acres of lands. He claimed those “serfs” would never found true happiness, and this idea bothered me since I’ve always been desiring more stuff under control. That makes me feel safe. But as I scrolled down the website, I felt surprised. I was kind of been persuaded by the author for his seemingly “out-of-date” ideas. The four parts he mentioned in this article was just like that of in the documentary Minimalist. The four aspects are food, shelter, clothing and fuel. For food, I feel absolutely guilty, since I really love meat, all kinds of, even if I know I have created more carbon footprints by doing it, I just cannot leave meat aside. But I will keep on trying to transfer to a plant-based diet style. What’s more, as a Chinese, we’ve done a lot in reducing carbon footprint in housing, since we are densely populated, so we are forced to co-house, or live in tiny apartments. Compared to American rural large houses, Chinese has done a lot in reducing carbon footprints per person. For clothing, I’m sure my mother has caused a lot than I did. I can basically keep all of my dressed items into a tiny closet. Yet, my mom didn’t get enough space for her clothing even if he took over my and dad’s places. As I went to the middle of this course, I gradually grow a strong faith to save our environment, and minimalist living style provides me a good way to apply my idea. It’s amazing, and I hope all can at least read the article and watch the documentary to embrace the idea of minimalism.

After reading Walden, I have to say that Thoreau made a simple lifestyle look very satisfying. He did bring up some good points about how dumb our reasons for maintaining our lifestyles are too. I found this to be very true for his reasoning why we should have a vegetarian diet. Not going to lie, this would probably be my hardest lifestyle change and I have always brought up it is hard to supplement meat from your diet. Thoreau’s statement about how oxen have a vegetarian diet and still maintain their bulkiness made me rethink my stance. Western lifestyle is not necessary and it creates more problems for ourselves. He is right that we are creating our own self imposed slavery because we give ourselves more work by cleaning a house that is too big, working on a farm that is too big or buying clothes when you already have enough. It is not needed and it does not help our environment. I have always seen this to be true in the fashion industry. It is stupid that we just dispose of clothes that are perfectly fine. We as a culture just waste and it does need to end.

 <br><br>

Again, there is no excuses because Thoreau was able to get by just fine. Sure, I understand it was a different time, but there are many people today who are satisfied with a minimalist lifestyle. Us as college students don’t have a lot, but there is a lot more we could be doing. For example, people can not waste food in the dining hall and eat what they can eat and over. We can thrift clothes in order to make sure they are not going to waste. Most importantly our demand or lack of it will send a message to our current economy that is in support of hurting our environment. By not buying clothes, meat, large housing and other unneeded things, we are telling the market and sellers that we are uninterested, forcing them to change and sell to accommodate our new wants as a society. We can do more for ourselves by having less.

It's true. You can get a sufficient amount of protein on a plant-based diet. For me it's hard because I love the taste of meat. I know it's selfish, but it's so good. I have been limiting my consumption of beef though, and I know that's good, but I still feel bad about how most chickens are treated before they are slaughtered to be eaten.
      <br><br>
      It's much easier for me though to buy less clothes and items though. I don't like to have more just for the sake of having more. I'm with you in that I hope our culture moves more towards only taking what we need in order conserve resources and help the environment, as well as improve our ability to be content with what we have as was discussed in the article.

I definitely feel like it's easy to get caught up in the extravagance of our urban lifestyles, but Thoreau's Walden really sheds light on the merits of a minimalistic way of living. Upon reading this chapter, I first questioned how one could possibly live with only the bare minimum essentials. However, as Thoreau went more in depth into his own experience, I started to understand his point. Our society is so driven by material things that we often forget that we truly don’t NEED all this stuff. I’ve found that some of the best times I’ve had were just sitting with friends and talking or living life simply. 

      <br><br>

Living life the way Thoreau described in the first chapter of Walden would not only be good for our environment and reduce our carbon footprint but also be good for ourselves. I do think that because Thoreau wrote this in the 19th century, the circumstances are quite different from now in the 21st century. However, everything he says is still very relevant and important, if not even more relevant in today’s society. Our overconsumption has polluted the earth and will make it uninhabitable if we continue these practices. I have faith that if everyone just cut down on consumption and buying excess stuff just a little bit, there would be a big change.

I completely agree with you. We live in a world where we constantly need the newest and greatest thing, creating a competitive culture among our counterparts. It is a vicious cycle starting with the rich and famous. They bring a certain item into trend, causing their fans and followers to desire this specific item. Once their followers obtain it, then their friends are instigated to purchase more. Overall, consumer culture is fueled by competition. Also, I agree with you that our society is too advanced to go back to the way Thoreau described. However, I do think spreading awareness about the negative effects of consumption could create a new mindset for consumers, eventually leading to a decrease in consumerism. This could ignite the change we need to live simpler and more environmentally friendly lives.

“Simplify, simplify”, do these words sound like America? NO. We want to be bigger, better, and we are always expanding our ideas of a successful lifestyle. I know people today that have multiple houses and cars. We have several pairs of shoes and wardrobes that could make the 19th century folk dizzy. There was a time when American got maybe one new pair of shoes a year. Clothes were worn repeatedly. We look back on this and think that they lived such drab lifestyles. However, Thoreau has a point and he would be disgusted by the way we live today. Why do we buy into “fleeting” trends? Do they really make us cooler or give us higher status? I have been wearing hand-me-downs the majority of my life and I don’t think anyone has seemed to notice. A harder idea for me is going vegetarian. If you think about it from an evolutionary and scientific perspective, we have evolved mechanisms within our psychology to drive us to desire to eat meat. This is because it is more calorically dense and our ancestors who ate meat were more likely to survive to reproductive age. In this way I think that Thoreau is asking us to reverse this part of evolution. Some could argue he is asking us to go backwards entirely. Who would want to abandon our luxurious cars, houses, clothes, foods, and lifestyles in general. I will tell you who. The people who want to continue breathing clean air, the people who want to see the coral reefs again, the people who want to have clean drinking water, and the people who are willing to fight against climate change are the people who would be willing to abandon luxury for sustainability. We don’t have to follow the status quo and if someone handed me a scripted life I wouldn’t want to live it. I want to make my own way. I don’t want to act like im happy due to possessions. I want to actually be happy because of all the beauty in the world.

"Walden" is a testament to how simple our lives need to be for inner richness. I agree that as we continue to expand and live more lavishly that we are distancing ourselves from Thoreau's proposed blueprint for life. It is sad to see so many people succumb to the disease of vanity. The more we look towards others for respect the less we look at our own values and interests. As Thoreau mentioned in "Walden" we receive a sense of equilibrium by placing ourselves in nature, that is not something we can do living in concrete jungles. 
<br><br>
As for the comment on switching to becoming a vegetarian, it is a biological trait to fulfill an omnivore's perspective on the world, however, we are stronger mentally than our biological intuitions. It is a hard transition initially,  but the more educated you become on the matter, the easier it becomes. I don't necessarily think that becoming vegetarian is the most plausible solution, but you can become a "reducitarian" by just reducing the amount of meat based products in your diet. It is much easier to do and you won't have to sacrifice very much!

It is true that much of the American lifestyle has come down to stuff -- and just how much stuff we can shove into our homes and cars. And while it will be hard to convince the country (and world) to reduce their consumption, it is essential for us to make that shift. Although much of the specifics have changed since Thoreau's time, the overarching principles remain the same. We need to live in smaller homes, buy less clothing and reduce our consumption to essentials and, perhaps, the occasional luxury. 
<br><br>

The fact that this text was written more than 150 years ago and our problems have not changed is quite unnerving. In the 1850s, the concern may have been about limiting unnecessary consumption in order to enjoy life and save money, but now the concern is more dire and frightening: we need to keep our earth habitable. In Thoreau's time, a disaster like the climate crisis was likely unfathomable, so he focused on economic logic and comfort. Unlike Thoreau, we do not have the luxury of favoring comfort. Like in this week's film, "Minimalism", the message is clear: excessive consumption causes stress, unhappiness, lavish spending and, most importantly, devastating environmental effects. 
<br><br>

While it will be hard to change the association of success with stuff, it is crucial to do so before we have utterly doomed future generations. Wouldn't you rather give up shopping for a year than live somewhere where you can not drink the water or breathe the air?

You’re right that Thoreau would be disgusted with the way we live today. Even in my grandma's time, people lived so differently. I remember her telling me that she only had one pair of shoes for 4 years as a kid. When I was little I had 10 or 15 pairs of shoes at a time. Even though my mom was crazy for buying me so many clothes, and shes only one generation above her. The fact that Thoreau was already aware of overconsumption and materialism in his time is crazy to me. People are just now starting to become aware of it on a bigger scale and that's only because it's starting to affect us in ways that are jeopardizing our precious materialistic lifestyles. I honestly don’t think that its that difficult to make the changes necessary to become a minimalist. I kind of disagree with you about the change to vegetarianism. I also thought it would be hard, but just last month I made the switch from a normal diet to vegan, and it has not been as difficult as I anticipated. Thoreau is right that vegetarianism is the best option. We don’t need meat in our lives as much as we think we do. We, especially in America, are so conditioned to eat certain ways and dress certain ways that we lose track of what is important to our well being and happiness.

According to the reading, Thoreau is asking us to abandon current life which causes a lot of waste back to a more natural lifestyle. However, I had the same idea with you. Humans spent thousands of years to evolve and develop a life that comforts people. It is so hard for us to give up all of our efforts. Humans spent so many years creating numerous delicious food menu. It is the treasure of human. However, Thoreau appeals we to be vegetarian. Although I know, being vegetarian is helpful for saving the environment, it is so hard for me to actually do this. It is a pity to abandon the treasure that our ancestors left to us. Also, it is the same when it apply to our consumption of cars or clothes. Because we had the intention to be more flourishing, scientists spent so much time and effort to invent better innovations. If we are going to abandon them, the money and the time spent on these inventions would be wasted. And from my personal perspective, it is hard for me to give up current life which brings me a lot of convenience and happiness.

As people we always want more. Many say that when they get older they are going to give their kids everything that they never had. This means more clothes, more shoes, a bigger house and many more materialistic items. Just like you I had hand me downs my entire life. I never wanted to wear them because I always thought that people were somehow going to know that they were hand me downs and I didn’t want to get bullied from it. Later on I realized that hand me downs are honestly one of the best things you could have, it doesn’t get better than free clothes. Plus it helps to reduce our consumerism. Nowadays people are always flexing how much they have, how expensive their clothing is, buy a new outfit and wear it only once. Honestly I couldn’t care any less about fashion trends that go on around me. I wear whatever I would like to, not because others are wearing the next “hot” fashionable clothing I am going to go out of my way to buy the same article of clothing. I think that the world around us and the beauty of nature is what truly makes man happy.

It’s hard to imagine the United States being simple. I, too, know families of 5 or less  living in huge homes that could potentially house over double  that amount of people.  I see these things everywhere, even if its not physically right in front of me. Television shows and socials media elevate this idea that more stuff equals happiness. Most of us have grown up with this idea all around us, fueling our addiction to consumerism. Thoreau points out in the reading that these extra things we pride ourselves in aren’t really necessities. We can be happy without them, in fact, he says they’re obstructing the “elevation of mankind.” It’s  like we put so  much importance on materialistic objects that we forget about taking care of ourselves and the planet. Consumerism has had dramatic impacts on the planet. From emitting toxic levels of pollution to the filling of landfills, it has changed our planet for the worst. Thoreau makes a comparison to slavery where he criticizes that many of us have become slaves to our own minds and changing that Is not easy. We think that we NEED expensive cars and huge homes to truly live, but we cant get locked into this mindset. The planet ideally provides us everything we truly need to survive. They are simple: food, shelter, clothing, and heat (energy). One thing I like about Thoreau’s way of writing is that he emphasizes an individualistic approach to change, which I think is an important perspective. Making a change in your own life can make a difference in helping the climate crisis. As I’ve seen a lot of people comment on previous posts, they have been able to get families and friends more involved in the climate movement. Even when you thinks no ones watching, someone always is and you might be the one to introduce them to a new way of thinking.

Reading Thoreau's Walden, I was very compelled by his arguments and thought of all the ways I could minimize the goods I use and simplify my lifestyle. But as I continued through the piece, I began to recognize myself getting a little annoyed at Thoreau's arguments. I think great points are made throughout the piece... in terms of 1854. While Thoreau's overarching ideals of simpler lives and escaping our industrialized world may have made a lot of sense then, I think it's unrealistic today. I think we can very well embrace a similar mentality regarding our usage  of luxury goods and excess meat consumption, however there are many things that may be considered excess to Thoreau that we need to embrace. If we all embraced this "back to nature lifestyle," our world would regress so far and we would lose much of the technological and positive progress we have made.
<br><br>
On a larger scale, I think Thoreau's proposition is an existential one. What truly is the purpose of our lives? Similar to the "script" of our life you addressed in the video, I think Walden is supposed to make us question the direction of humanity. Maybe it would have been best for our species to stay as they were thousands of years ago and continue life on a fairly modest scale. Yet at our current point in humanity, it is too late to turn back and live the way proposed by Thoreau. We must continue our technological innovation and fix the environmental problem we have made because we live in 2020, not 1854.

In a similar sense of what you are addressing, Thoreau mentions in his discussion on labor that he does "not wish to spend [his] time in earning rich carpets or other fine furniture, or delicate cookery" and he emphasizes the value of freedom to him. He does point out that for some people working is most valuable and satisfactory for them, but for him, he would rather have the freedom so why work more just to afford a fancy and useless carpet. I ask myself the same question for many people who I see them working extra shifts so they can afford the newest or best version of something and I have to wonder, what value does the most expensive version have over the basic version. 
<br><br>


I also agree with your point about the inability for us to go back and try to completely revert to the olden days. It is interesting to hear this point of view from someone in the 1850s but there is still a lot that is different in our society, so we have to think about how to apply what was prevalent in the 1800s and modify them for the 21st century.  Maybe for some people, it's possible to get rid of all technological innovation and live a simple life, but I don't think there is any shame in owning and supporting technological advancements, because many inventors have worked endlessly to create great products. However, I do believe there is an excess in the production of upgrades. Why do companies need to upgrade and make a new device whenever one new, small advancement is possible, why not wait until there can be a bigger change. 

<br><br>

So just like you posed the question... what is the purpose of our lives? Are we supposed to keep advancing and improving and finding a way to be better or are we supposed to completely stop big advancements and stay modest and minimalistic in our lifestyles?

While overall I feel that the opening chapter of "Walden" conveys a good messages in the sense that Thoreau emphasizes the problem of mass consumerism within society while advocating for a minimalist lifestyle, there were a few parts of the chapter and the overall book which left me feeling slightly annoyed. On page 25, Thoreau describes how he came to be living in a very small house near Walden Pond, explaining that he purchased it from an Irish family who then moved out the following morning. Seeing them leave that morning on his way to move in Thoreau writes, "One large bundle held their all-- bed, coffee-mill, looking glass, hens--- all but the cat". This part of the chapter stuck with me in particular because I realized that while Thoreau is moving into the forest as a type of experiment, there were so many impoverished families who had no choice in the matter, and could only afford an extremely humble lifestyle with very few belongings as this Irish family did. Along with this, Thoreau didn't even stay in the woods living this way for the rest of his life, or even a very long time, as he states in the first few pages that he only lived near Walden pond for two years and two months, and then decided to go back to life as usual in the city. As I have read "Walden" before I know that overall, Thoreau is attempting to persuade the reader to leave society, and adopt a very minimalist lifestyle in the wild as he did for a few years. While in theory, this might seem like it could be a good idea in terms of eradicating our society's consumerist-centered ideology, I honestly feel like it's a really impractical solution. If everyone did this as Thoreau did, we really would only be running from the problems that we've caused in terms of climate change. Thoreau kind of just went and hid in the forest for a few years, and never faced any of the problems of climate change head on.

Upon reading Walden last quarter and refreshing on it, I still wonder about his impact that Thoreau had when he drove to the city for some of his needs. I understand the spiritual aspect of living in nature that is not industrialized or populated and how zen it would be. He advertised his movement as finding the meaning in life which was exactly what he did, although it didn’t last very long. I enjoy the idea of living with less but at the same time, I know that I enjoy my space and materialistic items just like the average person. The impact of consumerism is taking a huge toll on the environment due to the demand for the products which are created out of the earth’s unsustainable materials. I also want to point out that the house he built was much larger than many others, but it was small to him. This shows us that he did try to make an effort to downsize his luxurious life and make it simpler. Many of us think that becoming more simple makes us look financially struggling, but in reality, it would keep the money in the bank account. When Thoreau breaks down his financial situation and showed how much he actually spent, it was shocking. We think we need to spend all this money to have a place to live, but in reality, it’s all just wasted space. 
<br><br>

He took the first step to become a minimalist and I give him credit for that. Many people these days might become simpler due to financial reasons but like Thoreau, others do it for spiritual reasons. The idea of becoming less dependent on materialistic happiness is scary, but also peaceful. We are almost imprisoned by consumerism and we think we need nice cars, clothes, and houses. All we need in our lives is a place to sleep, some clothes, and food. For example, phones are not a necessity like everyone thinks they are. But in the end, I would never give up mine. Eventually, we will have to decide what is more important to us, our freedom or temporary happiness.

Henry David Thoreau's Walden mainly addresses that the necessaries of life are food, shelter, clothing and fuel. The human necessity is to keep warm. However, he made a point that some luxuriously rich were "unnaturally hot" that they were almost "cooked." This analogy was stating that sometimes people's desires are over their need. "Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind." Thoreau criticized the meaning of luxurious items. They are the things that "cook" people.
<br><br>
When reading the beginning of the article, I was astonished by Thoreau's back to nature lifestyle. I feel that takes a lot of courage and clear thinking before actually living inside a cabin near a shore. Thoreaus says that simplicity is the meaning of life. The shelter people are living in should be small. The fashion industry should be criticized as they are trying to make people think that they always need something more fashionable and new instead of cherishing their current possessions. He also encourages vegetarianism and rejects the import of food. Ken concludes in the video that each human being's role is pre-decided before we are born. Many people just follow their already determined script through their life instead of making changes. Ken argues that we students should really rethink our roles and rewrite our scripts. We should be bold enough to make changes to our lifestyles and minimize our desires.
<br><br>
I feel so connect to the minimized lifestyle. These days people always feel they need more and better stuff. We always want the newest sneakers, the hottest cosmetics, the biggest house, the fanciest cars and etc. People always want the best in every aspect in their lives but ignoring that we are having ENOUGH. The commercials use this psychology of people to gain profits and people voluntarily step into their traps. We are always making comparisons with others and feeling we aren't having the best. Many are linking happiness with the quality and quantity of stuff we possess in daily lives.
<br><br>
However, personally thinking is that happiness can never come from the outside but the inside of people. It's true that a hot sneaker can bring people happiness for a while, but that happiness won't last long. If somebody is depending their happiness on things that can be bought by money, he/she will never find true happiness and meaning in life. Happiness should come from the things we have passion on, we devote our time on and we genuinely enjoy. 
<br><br>
Before reading this article, I bought lots of necessary stuff too just to make myself feeling I am not interior than others. I am having enough lipsticks but whenever I step into Sephora I always check what is new. That's really unhealthy lifestyle and consuming habits. I'm definitely gonna control my unnecessary desires and spend my money more wisely from today on.

After reading Thoreau’s Walden and watching Ken’s video I do think that yes, Thoreau was onto something with his overarching simplify message. Early on in the reading, Thoreau talks about how most men were like machines who were so caught up in the societal labors of life that they could never enjoy the best pleasures. I thought this was so applicable to the world today as it is so easy to get caught up in the societal pressures and standards that many people end up leaving lives of corruption with no real satisfaction. 
<br><br>
One point in the reading that I thought tied into our climate crisis lense really well was a point that no way of thinking can be trusted without proof. I thought this connected clearly to the climate deniers as they are convincing people to believe in their cause with no proof. This “way of thinking” that they are pushing is simply only that. It is not backed by proof and therefore should not be followed blindly. Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of scientists have actual proof to show to use as evidence behind the warming of our planet and the detrimental effects of fossil fuels. Another important point from the reading that I thought connected really well to the Minimalism film was Thoreau’s point about finding the real necessities of life. He talked in-depth about the baseline needs of food, water, and shelter, and how we’ve created false beliefs of all the extra things in life we believe we “need.” He showed himself in his explanation of his journey in Walden that satisfaction can come from the most basic needs in life and how cheap and sustainable it really could be to reach those needs.
<br><br>
 A quote I thought was really important was, “I brag for humanity rather than for myself.” Thoreau says this after explaining how he achieved his simple life in the wilderness and explained that he was not bragging on his accomplishments in a selfish light but rather that this is doable and better for our earth and society. We can take this message into our lives today surrounding our personal fights of the climate crisis. We can advocate and share the ways in which we are helping the earth, not in a way of vain attention seeking but in hopes for humanity to catch on and activate as well.

I do think Thoreau was onto something with this piece. Initially I was confused as to why we were assigned it- I didn’t see how it could be applicable to modern climate issues. I found it really surprising how long ago this piece was written- so many of the ideas Thoreau discussed seemed so contemporary, and he discussed many of the issues we are still trying to fix now- a culture that feels stuck in buying into what we’ve always done- overproduce, over shop, overwork, etc. In all honesty, it was a bit distressing to see how many of the issues he addressed are still prominent today; from this reading I feel that many of these issues could have been dealt with a looong time ago. However, It was a nice compliment to the Minimalism film we had to watch this week, because it shows that this mentality of changing the way we live in simple ways is not a new thing, and a lot of their advice was the same, encouraging us to be bold enough to change the way we live for the better,
<br><br>
One moment I found particularly striking was Thoreau discussing the benefits of having a meatless diet, and how it can help us as well as the environment. Thoreau says “One farmer says to me, "You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with"; and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle”- which I feel not only emphasizes the benefits of a meatless diet, but also points out how easy it is to be oblivious to easy solutions to the climate crisis. The farmer was oblivious to the fact that all the oxen’s brute strength comes from its meatless diet, just in the same way many people are ignorant to the fact that having a meatless diet has direct physical and environmental positive effects. 
<br><br>
I also found it interesting that he emphasized the importance of downsizing our homes (ex. The living in a railway box idea he mentioned), and reducing the amount we play into fast fashion because I view those as really modern problems- I can’t imagine what they thought overproduction was then considering what it is now. He emphasized the value in just buying clothing/shoes/accessories/tools etc. that are better quality so that they last longer and are nicer, which is good advice that I’ve heard before, and also applies to now really well because I think splurging on a nicer piece that you know will last a long time and will be utilized often is a lot more cost and environmentally efficient than constantly buying into fast fashion and trends.

Just like several other students in the comment section, when I first started reading Henry David Thoreau’s Walden I was thoroughly confused as to how and why this piece of literature would be relevant to our class and the climate crisis. However, after I finished reading the chapter and watching Ken’s lecture video about the reading, I realized that Thoreau’s work was more than a simple piece of literature; it was about an innovative, progressive, environmentally-friendly lifestyle that many of us might have failed to recognize while reading this literary work, and it was a lifestyle that had just received public attention due to its popularity on social media in recent years. This lifestyle is minimalism. 
<br><br>


I feel like in a sense Thoreau could be called as the founder of minimalism lifestyle because he decluttered his life to its simplest form as he could by reducing and removing unnecessary luxuries and distractions in his life during that time, such as huge houses, fancy brand clothes, meat food like steak and pork chop, and many more. Additionally, I thought it is very mind-opening and progressive for someone living in the 1800s such as Thoreau to oppose the popular wave of consumerism promoting an increase in and almost forcing popular consumption in goods that infiltrated in the society during that time. From this, we can infer that consumerism is not a modern phenomenon that it is not a societal trend that had just started recently but has always been there for a long time and could be traced all the way to the 19th century. It is even somewhat fascinating to me that as long as a society with humans exists there will almost always be consumerism and the desire to own more goods even though they are unnecessarily lavish and are indeed unnecessary in our daily lives. I think the root cause for this desire to own more “better”, lavish goods comes from the heavy social stratification and the need to demonstrate one’s socio-economic status through the ownership of those goods and the pride associating those goods with the results of people’s “hard-work”. 

<br><br>

Back to the topic of minimalism, Thoreau can be seen as, again, an almost pioneer-like figure in initiating modern environmentalist movement with his implementation of a minimalist lifestyle. I agree with Thoreau’s argument for living a minimalist life because after all we can only actually use and consume so many goods that basic necessities would be able to suffice our basic needs from day to day. I am actually attempting to incorporate minimalism into my daily life and routines recently and I am really glad to see how this decision is changing my life in a really positive way. For example, when I buy makeup and skincare products I would only go for the basic products that I know I need or I have tried on before and they really fit my skin type, instead of buying products that are massively advertised in the social media; when I need to buy clothes, I only buy the clothes that I absolutely need and I often try to visit thrift stores and buy used clothes that are still fashionable; when I do grocery shopping, I buy much more fruits and vegetables than meat that I try to only eat meat once or twice every week; even on my phone which I used to have countless apps and games I downloaded but had never opened since I just forgot about them after downloading, I deleted all of those apps and only kept the ones that I really need and use everyday. Speaking from my experience of applying minimalism into my daily life, I feel that this decluttering of my life has really made me more focused and efficient during the day that I will not be distracted by the unnecessary extra apps or things on my phone and in my life, and I had saved a lot of money buying clothes from thrift stores instead of buying brand-new clothes which are much more expensive and sometimes not as fashionable as the clothes from the thrift stores. Lastly, I feel more healthy from eating more vegetables and fruits than meat for my meals that I’m still obtaining the amounts of nutrients that I need from fruits and vegetables that have much lower calories and do not harm the environment as much. I am really glad for those positive changes in my life thanks to minimalism and I hope more people will start doing the same things and benefit from a minimalist lifestyle hopefully from the inspiration of Walden and Thoreau’s minimalist life.

After reading chapter one of the book Walden I was inspired by Henry David Thoreau’s ability to see that although most of us are given a certain role to play out for the rest of our lives at birth, we are not confined to that role.  I wholeheartedly agree with Ken when he says Thoreau can be looked at as the grandfather of the minimalist movement.  It leads me to wonder whether adopting this minimalist lifestyle was more outlandish then or now.  Part of me believes that back then it would’ve been seen as quite outlandish since there was no sort of minimalist movement or community at that time, so for all Thoreau knows he was the only person to jump into this lifestyle change.  Another part of me believes it would be much more difficult to adopt this lifestyle nowadays since we are so overwhelmingly materialistic.  Fashions go out of style and we feel the need to buy new clothes even though our “old” ones are still completely functional, new phones come out every year and we feel some sort of societal pressure to “upgrade” the one we currently have, even though it works fine, the houses we live in are massive, the things we own are disposable, etc.  And when we don’t have these things we consider ourselves lesser, or when we can’t afford these things we are poor.  Thoreau touches on this idea when he says “actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have.”  In saying this, he is referring to men that consider themselves poor because they do not have what their neighbors have, though what they have may be just as functional.  I don’t think Thoreau is saying they are wrong for thinking they are poor, I think he is questioning the societal construct that has been built up to make us feel like necessities aren’t enough, that we must be lavish and materialistic - or be looked down upon.

This chapter reminded me of the opening of SIlent Spring, especially in its complicated yet straightforward approach to the way in which man interacts with nature. Thoreau comments on the lifestyle where he would “ raise no more than he ate” and that if his crops had failed or his house burned, he “should have been nearly as well off as before.” This is really the same as saying “only take what you’ll use,” and it’s an important idea even outside of the environmental movement. Why waste food, supplies, or resources if unnecessary? The mindset of much of the US is bigger is better, with supermarkets overflowing with packaged food that people don’t actually need. Wouldn't it be cheaper to downscale production? He also ends the chapter with a remark on how those with plenty should share, and those that do not have a lot should live on the land. The biggest issue, is that we live in a capitalist society and when one is fortunate, their first thought isn’t how to spread the wealth. The reality is that 1% of the population are responsible for a majority of the wealth on the planet, which means, in a lot of ways, they have most of the power. And human selfishness means that their money is more than likely going to go in helping their own interests and establishing their wealth even more.

It almost seems like the only way to get anyone to do anything is to really put them in some fucked up shoes. What if you said “each time you do xyz, your daughter is going to suffer” how much would that motivate them?

After reading the excerpts from Henry David Thoreau’s 1854 classic Walden, I was surprised and appreciated his behavior as an early minimalist. He found problem in our daily lives——people excessively depend on materials to live. When we are not satisfied and feel empty inside, we need material to satisfy ourselves. In other words, our emotions can be easily changed by material. In the end of the video, Ken asked what reaction Thoreau would make if he see how people live today in twenty-first century. I think Thoreau would find it more necessary to spread the idea of minimalism to the public. Because people nowadays depend on material much more than people who live in the nineteenth century like Thoreau. Our generation must do something change this situation. Minimalism is a good idea which prevents us from wasting resources of the  Earth. Also, according to Thoreau, reducing our stuff does not mean we would feel unhappy. Rather, it could be a motivator to elevate our mood in daily lives.

As Henry David Thoreau written in the book Walden, the need of clothes is indeed the need of warmth for our human beings, which means we design clothes for its utility not for fashion at the first place. The story that monkeys in America would imitate what the monkey in Paris wear is hilarious yet provoke thinking about. This phenomenon is also projected on people's growing demand on the acres of house, as the house today are roughly 2.5 times compared to our last generation. With larger house comes larger consumption on designing/maintaining the house, and people believe that this large mansion can show one's success and outstanding status, which is in fact the opposite. We should never let the money constraint us, both for saving our planet earth, and also for the happiness for ourselves.


<br><hr>

I agree with you -- its interesting that Thoreau followed minimalist practices before it was in any sense a mainstream ideology. I think this is actually one of the most important things to take away from the reading -- that despite how much notions of comfort and the aspiration of the "American Dream" change with each generation, the gratification we can all get from living a simpler life hardly varies at all. What Thoreau discovered in the process of living in Walden and living in the most basic ways he could might be exactly the same as what someone from our generation could discover from the same process. 
<br><br>

With each generation, it seems like the U.S. becomes more and more driven by consumption. I feel like even my parents hold the philosophy that children should have everything their parents had, but more. Yet if we live under this ideal, we will exponentially grow into an unsustainable society. We need to start thinking in the reverse and decreasing our material possessions as we pass them on to our children. I agree with what Ken said in the lecture, that this will frighten many people or make them uncomfortable. However I think we just need to pay to attention to trends within history - there have been periods of high and low consumption/material goods, and happiness didn't necessarily coincide with how much money or assets a family had.

Thoreau makes the decision to move into a small cabin near Walden Pond in hopes to show society that a simple, non materialistic lifestyle is better than the conventional life they are in. He explains how working for pay is a form of enslavement from which people should free themselves from for, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation..." What Thoreau sees around him is troubling and he therefore believes that people must shake off culture's materialistic values as noted by love of luxury items. 
<br><br>

Like Henry David Thoreau I also believe that the minimalist movement has the ability to change a person’s life for the better. I belief that as college students we can promote a simplistic lifestyle. As college students we are already forced to share a room with others and therefore our space is limited. When I moved from my home in San Diego to live in Santa Barbara I had to go through all my things and decide what was necessary to bring along. When I looked in my closet and my drawers I realized I had a lot of clothing that I did not use but nevertheless it was still there taking up space. The idea of a tiny closet and a small wardrobe is actually genius. I am sure that many like myself take forever choosing out an outfit in the mornings because we have so many options but the options we have are pieces of clothing that are not necessarily in our taste anymore. If we all stuck to a few garments that we really liked instead of a lot that we do not, imagine how much easier it would be to put an outfit together. The time we would save could be used for other activities.

As you mentioned, Thoreau decides to move to Walden Pond to live a simplistic, nonmaterialistic lifestyle. He sends the message that people shouldn’t be tied down by society’s definitions of life and should be able to live in a new, fresh way.
 <br><br>

I wish I had taken minimalism and living simplistically more to heart before moving into UCSB. Although I also had to pick and choose the necessities, I feel like I overestimated the “necessities.” Like Aylin says, I find myself spending too much time in the morning choosing an outfit. If I had a tiny closet with a few basic clothing items, I wouldn’t have to pick between so many items. It got to the point where I decided to bring some clothes back home when I visited so I could live more simply in my dorm. Now I know it is possible to live without a lot of materialistic things, and I definitely am going to take this into account when I move into a small apartment next year.

Reading Thoreau's minimalistic approach in Walden was insightful because he discusses a lot of the different ways that today's or his society defined words like success vs. savagery. Doing so, he points out how clothes and the concept of "bigger is better" is a popular theme within people's lifestyles. Thoreau even mentions how some people may find it more socially acceptable to have a broken leg than wear a ripped pair of pants in public. While one has the ability to heal, the other can only be patched up but still very there, supposedly telling the world that you cannot afford any new ones. Doing this, he introduces the idea of minimalism. He wants the audience to recognize what are the essentials in life and how to live a life with just that. He challenges the audience to "ponder the role we are given at birth." 
<br><br>

Watching this video, it was interesting to see Ken's response to minimalism and its necessity within the new generation. I think Thoreau and the role he takes on in challenging an overly-bloated life was profound. Being in the 21st century, and imagining taking up that lifestyle while being surrounded by the technologies and consumer-culture I was born in seems very difficult, but I do agree with Ken that it is necessary. Imagining Thoreau in the same position as I am, I think he would also struggle because cars and telephones are also very essential to this era in its own way. While we could live without the two, there would be a lot of inconveniences, more specifically with telephones since a lot of jobs require one, and jobs = money, and money=food, housing. While living a minimalistic life will be challenging, I believe we do need to simplify. It may not be exactly in Thoreau's method, but cutting down on certain things could benefit the environment and our own well-being.

I read Walden when I was a senior in highschool and it is interesting to me how different I feel after reading it then versus how I feel after reading it now. I really did enjoy the memoir when I was in high school, but now after learning more about climate change and the amount of unnecessary tangible things that we as a culture have the book has more of an impact on me. I am able to see Thoreau now through a different light. I originally thought of him going off into the wilderness alone, miles from anyone so he can reflect on himself and learn to find himself, which I still deem to be accurate. However, now I am able to see that there was actually much more to the idea of finding himself. Being isolated with simply just nature and no materialistic things around you will definitely help you dive deep within yourself as a person, but now I am able to see that the meaning was more than that and how Thoreau is actually showing us that it is okay (and quite frankly a good thing) to live a simple and minimalistic life. I think that reading this chapter helps put where we are as a society into perspective because I feel as if it heightens the urgency for us to rid our materialistic goods and just have what we need to survive. If we were to all do this as a people, our issues of climate change would be close to being resolved.
<br><br>

 I know at the end of the book, Thoreau goes back to civilization after living years away from everyone on his own with nothing but what he needs. The fact that he did it and can do it (and actually feels more grounded with himself as a person after doing it) should be more of an incentive to not only be as minimalistic as you can be for yourself, but do it for the environment and everyone who is and already has been affected by the climate crisis.

After reading the first chapter of Walden, as well as watching Ken's explanatory video after having already delved into Walden last year, I share a similar experience with you in it impacting me differently the second time around. When I first read Walden, it was in the context of an environmental literature class; our primary focus centered on his survival tactics and building developments. However, now being equipped with the eye-opening information I've accumulated regarding the climate crisis, thanks to this course, I commend Henry David Thoreau for making a literary leap into the issue of rampant consumerism and over-indulgence. It is baffling to consider that this sustainable statement was portrayed decades ago, yet can still teach the majority of readers a lesson today. We are still in constant need of reminders to decrease our carbon footprint, live minimally, and reduce waste. In alignment with these reminders is Thoreau's advice to live not only with minimal material possessions, but also minimal disorder in our mentalities. I believe that switching to a more sustainable lifestyle is inevitably packaged with realigning our entire thinking process. For example, to sacrifice driving a oil-guzzling vehicle for a decreased footprint by transitioning to public transportation, one must accept the social implications. It may feel odd at first to choose options that are societally viewed as inferior or reflective of wealth.

Thoreau’s Walden was intended for us to live a simpler lifestyle. However, the messages from this chapter really resonated with the issue of climate crisis. First off, Thoreau talked about how items are more easily acquired than got rid of. This statement reminds me of a mattress. It’s easy for us to go into a store and purchase one but I forgot where I heard this from… a mattress is very difficult to recycle. Even professionals refuse to take them back to the recycling center because there are so many layers to a mattress. Therefore, it’s not worth the time and energy to do so. When I heard that, I think of all the mattresses I see on the street… obviously this big thing doesn’t fit in your recycle bin so people just left them on the side of the street, hoping someone would pick them up. Even though mattresses are considered a necessity to our daily lives, but was it necessary to get a new one so soon? I like how Thoreau described human actions as “throwing the stones over their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.” This analogy perfectly depicted the carbon footprint each person leaves behind, without knowing how much we are leaving behind. 
<br><br>

Perhaps not everyone is to blame. Sometimes we are so involved in other things in life like work and relationships. Like Thoreau said, “he has no time to be anything but a machine, how can he remember well his ignorance.” However, I believe we should incorporate the idea of consciousness into our actions. For example, when you go to a store, you could bring your own shopping bag. Make it a habit so you will do it more than once. Little things like this could potentially reduce a lot of bag production worldwide, which could potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the factory production sector. I was really amazed at Thoreau’s view on the fashion industry. I didn’t know it was an issue back then as well. Nowadays, people are so willing to follow trends and purchase items that would just sit in their closets forever, including me. I’ve watched a video in the past, criticizing how the fashion industry is also a culprit of climate change. These companies are trying to satisfy consumer demands; therefore, they just keep making clothes that won’t be purchased or would be purchased but not worn. Even my mom once told me that doing laundry is not great for the environment because of the microplastic that we are releasing into the ocean. Honestly, I feel so defeated because every action has consequences. How can I limit myself? And that’s still a major question that I ponder on. Lastly, I want to point out that Thoreau does mention people prefer to live in the countryside because they aren’t as many city dwellers. I remember watching one of Ken’s lecture videos and it had mentioned moving to the city or a smaller apartment could really help with the reduction of greenhouse gas because you would be riding public transportation. Perhaps your workplace is closer than you think, and a simple walk would suffice. Owning a large home is demanding with all the maintenance that’s required.

Walden written by Thoreau is a book worth pondering. From now on, his book is also forward-looking, and the problems he raised two hundred years ago still exist in modern society. In his economics chapter, Thoreau advocates a simple, independent, honest, and free life philosophy, which is also a kind of minimalism. Thoreau pointed out that human beings live by inertia, and what this social trend is doing, they will do anything. Hundreds of years ago, everyone was cultivating land and living on it. No one proposed a second way of survival. In modern society, as mentioned in the American Dream, we go to college, work, get married, everyone is going through this process, there is nothing strange. We never think about why we need to go to college, why we need work, why we need to get married, but to follow the trend of people to do things instead of thinking about what we should do. I think we should think about what kind of lifestyle is what we want, not give up thinking and just following inertia.

The two things that intrigued me most about the chapter of Walden we read was Thoreau's views on clothing and the way he went about building his shelter. Along with Ken's video complimenting the chapter, my eyes were opened to the clothing industry's wastefulness. I especially liked the point that we disregarding and throw away what "culture" says is out of style, just to buy what's in. I'm guilty of it just as most of us are. This made me wonder is it us, the consumers fault, is it at the fault of the clothing industry or even broader, is it or at the fault of our culture in general? This kind of relates to a point Ken made in lecture about how those who are convinced by climate change deniers aren't always at fault. However, I do believe that some of the blame must be put on the consumer in this case. Just keeping the clothes that each individual likes, not what culture deems popular, would seemingly have a huge cut down in waste.
<br><br>

Thoreau's description of building his house was intriguing to me because it was so calculated yet practical. He knew exactly how much it cost him. He knew exactly what he needed, without overindulging. He seemed to find the right balance between practicality and happiness. What amazed me  was how he only had what was essential, which in itself brought him happiness. This point weighed on me extremely hard. I went into an introspective state. I thought about all I had, the things I needed, as well as the things that aren't quite essential. It made me grateful, yet guilty. Thoreau was able to take only what was essential and be happy. While I understand we live in a very different time, I don't think it would be too hard to implement some on the minimalistic views Thoreau expressed in this chapter of Walden.

Walden:Economy by Thoreu continues to be an example of a lifestyle most of us can learn from. His piece focuses on the several aspects of consumption and how it is he chooses to do better by only consuming what he can justify for himself, whether economic or “dietic”. I agree with you in that his opinion over clothing and shelter are amazing as he exemplifies that there is truly no real need for having more other than the craving for “wanting”. 

<br><br>

You write, “This made me wonder is it us, the consumers fault, is it at the fault of the clothing industry or even broader, is it or at the fault of our culture in general?”
<br><br>
I’d definitely say culture, or the combination of consumers falling for what it is “producers” and our market puts out. From a very young age we are trained to acquire as much as we can because it is what “normal” people do. Whether it’s food, clothing, technology  or anything else, our society seems to have collectively agreed that MORE of something is a good thing. There is no denying the benefits of having options or more resources as consumers but like Thoreau I do think it’s important from time to time, maybe even on a daily, to take a step back and decide how it is what we consume will impact more than ourselves. I also agree with the point you make about clothing and the one Thoreau makes about his food/diet, the concept here isn’t to learn to not want more but to simply consume less, to stop having others enable us to the illusion that more is always better. 
<br><br>


You summarized a huge point of this text by stating, “He seemed to find the right balance between practicality and happiness”, something I believe we all have the ability to do. Taking steps for a more sustainable future doesn’t look like a single method. For one it may be purchasing less clothes or technology for others it may be riding a bike or completely changing their diet, regardless looking for a way to justify our consumption to ourselves can also lead to so many other positives over the issue of climate change.

It is truly astonishing to me that Thoreau’s ideas of simplicity in all life aspects, such as clothing, shelter, and diet, parallel the asks of today’s climate supporters. Thoreau calls for the reuse of old clothing and the avoidance of buying new clothing items, as the current ones will work perfectly fine. Climate progressives, similarly, encourage thrifting and upcycling of clothing to limit waste and the need for the production of new clothes. Further, just as Thoreau advocated for minimal housing space, climate specialists, too, urge people to take up small or even communal living areas. As Thoreau mentions a vegetarian diet is most simplistic and sustainable, these environment advocates also promote the usefulness and sustainability of such. It is quite intriguing to me that these same themes encouraged all the way back in the 1800’s are recommended once again. However, it should be made clear that there is a difference in the necessity of these suggestions between the past and present. In Thoreau’s time, these ideas were proposed in order to help individuals find happiness in their own lives of simplicity. Today, these themes are presented as more threat-like, as if we don’t follow these guidelines and make these changes in our lives, we will continue to kill the planet on which we live, thus having no opportunity to find happiness because life will no longer exist.

I remember reading Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden” during high school and hating it. Reading the first chapter again, now with a different outlook and perspective on what I was reading, I found that Thoreau made some great points about luxuries in the nineteenth century. Obviously, as Ken was commenting on, luxuries today are not even close to the same as they were when Thoreau wrote this book. Thoreau explains that if you wanted luxuries in the nineteenth century, that meant that, basically, you wanted to be warm. He claims that with so many people wanting (with emphasis on wanting) the luxury of being warm, they are overheating our earth trying to get it. To address Ken’s question of what Thoreau would think about twenty first century consumerism today, I think he would be regretfully surprised that the Earth has melted away yet anyways. Thoreau addresses many problems in this chapter that are still very relevant today, including cutting down on our needs for excessive clothing and giant houses; these are two of the five things Ken mentioned last week that we could address to help cut down our personal carbon footprint. Interestingly enough, we should all take some advice from Thoreau’s lifestyle in the nineteenth century and start applying it to our twenty first century lives if we want the Earth to survive another couple thousand years.

I totally agree with the comment you have made here. I also read Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden”during my high school career, and it gives me a different experience for the novel. After taking Ken's class, I start to look at the environmental problems in the book at a different point of view. Ken's class taught us to consider not only several environmental problems, but it placed us on a "God's view". That's why we know that environmental problems is killing step by step, and it's not an easy problem to fix. Like you've said, in this book people has luxury that different with what we have today. people's desire is to get warm, so they are basically overheating the earth to satisfy themselves. The Earth are melting away. I agree with the point that we should cutting the giant house and unnecessarily clothing to decrease the pollution. That what Thoreau addressed in the book, and Ken also stated it in our class. I believe we should take Thoreau's advice and change our lifestyle. I understand that is not a simple thing to achieve, but if we don't do something now, it will be to late to save our earth.
summarized a huge point of this text by stating, “He seemed to find the right balance between practicality and happiness”, something I believe we all have the ability to do.

I agree that reading this within the context of minimalism greatly added to my appreciation to this work. That being said I still didn't enjoy reading this, but that is not the point of this. I also agree with ken’s points about the change in luxuries that we have become accustomed to, but I also believe that these are a product of economic, technological and societal emphasis on raising the overall standard of living. For this reason, I don't believe that we as western societies should feel guilty for living comfortably. 
<br><br>


With that being said, I agree with your point in that we can all downsize our homes and stop leading materialistic lives. I have consciously tried to limit my purchases, along with overall emissions. Within a society that turns a blind eye to their emissions, however, this can be difficult when I choose to leave my house. Having to drive, consume single-use plastics when shopping for food, are among the many reasons why it has become difficult to truly cut carbon emissions without societal change.

<br><hr>
I agree with what you said above. I read this article after watching the minimalism film, which really helps me to understand the article a lot. I was really surprised that, at that time, in the nineteenth century, Thoreau incredibly have the kind of idea which is similar to that of the minimalism today. He had already had the idea of live a simple life and leave all the unneeded things behind. It is still even hard for many of us today. 
<br><br>
Although I do not think that everyone should do as what Thoreau did to leave the modern life behind and go back to the old kind of live people had before, which is not realistic for most of us, we should try something similar to minimalism to reduce the unneeded luxury things in our life in order to make our life more simple and happier. Moreover, this can also help reduce the emission of green house gases and help with the process of controlling the climate crisis.
<br><hr>
I agree, I had to read this book last year when I took English 22 and did not enjoy reading it. It was actually hard to get through for me last year, but this time around I was able to see the points made clearer. I still did have difficulties getting through it again, but really like the overall theme of leaving your "usual life" and trying out something new and going against the norms. I think living with less items really does make you admire the things you have. It also seems like a simpler life would be peaceful. Like you mentioned, it is very interesting to see how all of this connects with what we have been learning throughout this class. It really makes you think about how much you consume and ways you can change.

Before reading Thoreau's Walden, I had no prior knowledge about Thoreau's relationship with the environmental movement at all. Learning that he was actually the grandfather of the movement, it intrigued me to read the chapter through an environmental perspective instead of just as any old literature.
<br><br>

 Minimalism now in our century seems to be a very difficult habit to get into because of how much stuff everyone has. The fact that Henry Thoreau was able to live a minimalist life in 1845 where they did not even have as much stuff as we do now, truly is baffling and sad to think about. He was able to give up what he had when we in our century, are too greedy and selfish to do anything close to it. If we were to try to take up Thoreau's challenge, there would be a lot of division in participating. As mentioned in the previous lectures, people do not want to give up what they have worked for. The American Dream has filled our minds as being how much can you buy and keep to your name. It is more important for people for have multiples of things than only what is necessary.
<br><br>

I found it interesting how Thoreau stripped away the luxuries in terms of type of housing, clothing, and food. He was against the fashion industry in Paris during his time. As Ken mentioned this, it kind of intrigued me to think about the fashion industry then and now. 
<br><br>

In some way, I think there are many Thoreaus of our generation that are in the making. Many young people are unknowingly taking up his challenge through vegetarianism, sustainable fashion, and living in apartment type houses. We as college students kind of do the same as we live in multi person apartments and dorms.
<br><br>

Overall, my favorite takeaways from reading Thoreau's Walden was just knowing the context and details in which he lived. He lived like this because he genuinely wanted too. In the generation we live in now, it is now pretty necessary to take on the lifestyle he lived. We are in a crisis as we have learned. Taking steps such as vegetarianism to fight the meat industry, having less clothes or sustainable clothes to decrease our carbon footprint, and living in smaller houses, are all now important steps. The question is whether we should take up his challenge. The obvious answer is yes, but comes with many lifestyle changes that people do not want to accept.

I totally agree with your opinion. The important thesis of Thoreau's Walden is state the methods of Minimalism and advocate people to consider whether we can adapt to this kind of life. In China, our parents always tell us that it is easy for people to change from simple things to expensive things, but it is extremely difficult for people to get back to simple life style after we have experienced luxurious life. This is a truth, an obvious truth. Nowadays, in our society, we can experience the convenience of public transportation; we can experience high efficiency of private transport; we can experience high developed technology; we can experience many new product from various factories. However, as we care about the quality of our life, is there anyone thinking about the consequences after our happiness? Many people may say that we know current situation from TV, from Internet, from many social medias, but is there anyone could stand out and lead us to pay attention to and change this situation?  In my opinion, it is too subjective for us to think naturally that our life should be like this. There are so many challenges in our whole life. We definitely can overcome them as we have enough courage and determination. Now, the change in daily life is one of the challenge that we have to face, and all of us should consider about it and prepare well for it!

In Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden”, he calls upon society to reconsider a life of materialism and to break free from the cycle of striving for money. One line that stuck out to me was “It is a fool’s life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before.” We can spend our whole lives in pursuit of material goods, but in the end that will never be enough to make us happy. Thoreau is able to recognize the difference between the bare necessities of life and the luxuries. He criticizes society’s norm of enslaving ourselves to work solely for pay and dedicating our entire lives to this cycle, for “he has no time to be anything but a machine.” We commit ourselves every day to the uncertainties of life and deny that these things are an  impermanent solution. By doing this we are conforming to the idea that our worth is determined by how much we own and this will always leave us unsatisfied. Thoreau spent his years at Walden pond living solely on his own labor and acquiring only the basic needs of survival: food, clothes, snd shelter. He only worked the amount necessary to provide for himself, leaving the rest of the time for him to reflect and enjoy nature. 
<br><br>

While Thoreau’s rejection of materialism and society is severe, his message is still one that we all should listen to. When it comes down to it, do we really need these huge houses? Or all of these clothes and cars? We just want to impress others with our wealth, and that is causing serious destruction to our environment. If all of us were to reduce our consumption, we could drastically reduce our carbon footprints. He also encouraged vegetarianism as a way to reduce our impact on the world, and today this cause is even more relevant with how much harm the meat industry is doing to our planet. Ken’s description of how his generation did not give up the life scripted for them, like Thoreau encouraged, is interesting because it forces our generation to think about what we are scripted to do and how we can break away from these societal expectations. In the end all we have to do is “simplify”.

I completely agree with what you wrote, and I feel that I should add to it. I believe that one of the most interesting things about “Walden” is the fact of when it was written. The book was written in 1854 of the 19th century, this is almost a century before consumerism especially took off after World War II. Henry David Thoreau believed that people during his time were overindulging, I wonder how he would react to the way the world has become now.
<br><br>

People today have become so absorbed in the idea of buying new things that they seem to have little to no value to what they already have. I’ve seen people buy multiple sets of clothes one day, and then barely a week later they will buy even more clothes and not wear their previous clothes again. I’ve seen children beg their parents for a new toy and when they get it, they will play with it only a few times and then beg for different toy, and their parents still indulge them. This is where I believe the whole trend begins, most people are raised to think that we gain happiness from all the new things we buy and the joy comes from buying them. Some people are beginning to break away from this trend, but there still are those who are still stuck in this cycle that will never end for them.


<br><hr>
As I was reading this, I thought about the same ideas you are talking about. I enjoyed how Henry David Thoreau expresses his opinions on how materialistic our world is becoming. I feel like it is so easy to fall into that routine of just going to work, receiving our paycheck, and then going and spending on it on useless things that we will soon throw away and it will be wasted. Thoreau says, “What pains we accordingly take, not only with our Food, and Clothing, and Shelter, but with our beds, which are our night-clothes, robbing the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter, as the mole has its bed of grass and leaves at the end of its burrow!”. He is illustrating how obsessed society is with owning all of our stuff that doesn’t actually enhance our well being of life.Thoreau encourages a more simple approach to life by living without all of this stuff that doesn’t really make us happy and living a life that is full of purpose by being more connected to nature. 
<br><br>

You bring up an important point by asking questions like “Do we really need all of this stuff?” and we really do not. I feel like we just want the big house, the nice car, and the new clothes because it’s what is expected of us. Thoreau states, “The whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by their predecessors, both the heights and the valleys, and all things to have been cared for”. For the people who grew up with a lot of belongings, they might want to continue to keep all of those nice things, and for the people who didn’t, they might long for all of the nice stuff they never had. But in reality, we don’t really need stuff to truly make us happy. Professor Hiltner even says that our belongings are said to have made his generation happier but if you really look closely, they aren’t. By living a life of simplicity, one is more likely to live a better quality life through their experiences.

<br><hr>

I agree with your comment. The life that Thoroeu has chosen to live and the challeneg that he has masde to a consumer and materialistic society is the choice that we are now forced to make. The fact is the world is in very bad shape and the clock keeps ticking for us to fix the mess that we and all generations befrore us have made. His harsh crticism of those that have fallen victiim to the norm template of a “sucessful life” is as true today today as it was back then, however instead we have more reason to accept his challenge and flip the script given to us. 
<br><br>
I love how in the beginning of the chapter Thoreau calls attention to the cycle of debt in our society and we a society love to spend money we don’t have. I always belived this was the most obvious thing we do to prove that we are followers socieital norms as we are willing to dig a financial whole for ourselves that we will then dedicate ouselves to climb out of. The United States is about 23 trillion dollars in debt and I can garuntee that that money has been spent on things that have contributed extrodinary amount of carbon emissons. Again, I am in complete agreement with you, we need to simplify.

<br><hr>
I completely agree with your response, especially the point about how we dedicate our lives to a cycle focused on obtaining material items, leaving us with “no time to be anything but a machine.” To break out of this habit, I believe we need to truly reflect on our actions and how we are contributing to these societal norms. Breaking script may be difficult at first because all we have learned to do is work towards owning more things, as this though process has been wired into our minds since we were young children and has almost become subconsciously ingrained into our lifestyle. Not only does this trap give us a false sense of happiness, but it also has real and profound impacts on the environment. While Thoreau did not necessarily focus “Walden” on an environmentalist lens, its lessons can still be applied. There is no tangible benefit to buying more clothes from the fast fashion industry when we already own more than enough to wear; there is no tangible benefit to owning a mansion when our housing needs can be fulfilled by a much smaller property. Luxury items, as well as an excess of items, only serve the purpose of instant gratification, even that is lost the moment something new comes onto the market and the cycle of longing for more begins again.

Thoreau's arguments are timeless truths, the fundamentals of which apply to every culture and society. He proposes simplicity as a prevention and a cure to current toils, while describing how a lack thereof has served to create them in the first place.  I feel like when the climate crisis gets boiled down to its base parts, it is directly related to human greed and materialism. If our lifestyles were purely geared towards necessities, we would not be in this predicament. If we were to truly want to solve the climate crisis then we would aim to eliminate the source of it- greed. I hate to turn this into a philosophical issue, but almost everything in this world is. And I know there is no formula for eliminating greed but Thoreau prompts us to consider it as a common denominator worthy of contemplation at the very least. A life of simplicity, as he proposes, involves relinquishing most if not all superfluous aspects of living. This involves working for companies in order to support living costs, while instead, one could work for himself and promote self-sufficiency. According to Thoreau, the human desire to earn money and buy things leads to insatiable greed and ultimately a loss of inner freedom. If everyone only lived within their means and allowed for only a few simple luxuries, there would be no poverty, no famine, and no dying planet. By vowing to live simply, humans would eradicate big money hungry corporations, corrupt industries, and society's wasteful mentality towards 'things.' People are so counterproductive in how they satisfy desires. We think that in acquiring more, we will desire less. Time after time, we see that that is not the case, but instead the more we acquire the more we desire, and the less we have the less we want. Cutting one's life down to bare essentials and simple pleasures is the most conducive for a happy existence. 

<br><br>

However, I am well aware that this kind of lifestyle, especially on a global level, is a bit beyond the realm of possibility at the moment. The main point is, the biggest impact the consumer can have on reversing climate change is through simplified living. Stripping down one's life to primarily necessities strengthens conscientious living and weakens materialism. This, in turn, will produce healthier people and a healthier planet. Capitalism and consumerism in America has become cancerous, reaching colossal heights and perpetuating a mentality of wastefulness, materialism, and insatiable greed. While we can, and quite frankly must, develop technology to balance anthropogenic climate change, these kinds of problems will follow us until the end of time. That is, until we as humans change the way we think;  less self-serving and more moral and virtue based, hardship and catastrophe will continue to arise.

I find it extraordinary that even someone of Thoreau’s time disliked the new consumerism and recognized its negative impact on the earth. I also find it surprising that consumerism already had such a hold on society even back then. I have always considered consumerism and the climate crisis to be a more modern problem, so Walden really helped me gain a new perspective upon that. As someone who has already read Walden, it was still fascinating to reread it and analyze expense charts again. Of course, Thoreau was a rich man so Walden comes off as a handle on how to live poor by a rich person, but the fundamentals that Thoreau was advocating for are very insightful. The very fundamental message of his book was the idea of cutting down. Cutting down saves you money, and is much better for the environment.
 <br><br>
One of the ideas that were presented that I really liked was the connection between happiness and consumerism. Many people purchase many items in hopes that it will make them happy, and when it doesn’t, they turn and buy more. This is because businesses advertise their items so that you feel that if you purchase or obtain the item you’ll obtain the happiness that comes with it. This, however, leads to many people buying things that they don’t need and creating more waste in the world. I think Walden really touches on this subject as Thoreau advocates for a more minimalistic life. I find that fascinating and I think it is something many people should try. Cutting down on buying things that you don’t need that much of is a very good idea that I think many people could start applying to their daily lives, and quite easily, too. After cutting out the rampant consumerism from our lives, maybe we can all start seeing a deeper meaning in life as well as helping the environment.

While reading Walden, I noted that it seemed very forward thinking for his time as well. He remarked about the consumerism that affected people during his time. He also described so-called luxuries as “hindrances to the elevation of mankind”. I agree with your conclusion that cutting back on things makes people more happy, as well as benefits the natural environment. Thoreau emphasizes that one cannot adequately live their life if they have too many material belongings dragging them down. 
 <br><br>

On another note, Thoreau offered another uncommon argument in “Walden“. He mentioned that he had never received a useful piece of information from someone who was his elder. Was he possibly making a reference to how our generation is more willing than others to mitigate the environmental consequences of past generations? This is probably a stretch but it’s a different perception of one of  Thoreau’s beliefs. It seems to me that Thoreau was very forward thinking during his time and remains that way to this day.

Through Thoreau’s wise words I see the value of his minimalistic lifestyle and how that allowed him to change his own perspective on his life. Without all the clutter and miscellaneous unnecessary junk he was able to focus on the things that truly matter. To him, his connection to nature was a big part of his own internal focus and meaning, but this could vary from person to person. I value his mission to teach his readers not only what he has learned on his own journey but how to incorporate this into their own lives. Having less material items in his view leads to self criticism within self reflection. After watching the Minimalist film as well as reading this, I want to begin to remove some of the “clutter” from my life in the form of material objects in order to focus on myself and have positive effects on the environment. I do not necessarily feel unhappy or restricted in my current lifestyle, but I am curious to see what the alternative lifestyle that Thoreau describes would feel like for myself personally. Just like any other consumer, since birth I followed my role in the play of my life and enjoyed consuming items. Obviously the items I find the imitation version of joy from have changed drastically over time, but I am guilty of loving items that are not necessary for my basic everyday needs. I feel lucky to have the parents and upbringing that I did since some of what Thoreau criticizes about society I feel that I am not necessarily a part of. When he discusses that many people chase wealth and social status instead of being in touch with themselves I would claim that I am on the same side as him. Even though I am not nearly as in touch as he is, I really do believe that I can evaluate what is truly important to me as an individual. Nonetheless, removal of material items and “clutter” to truly focus on myself and be critical of the way I live my life would still be beneficial. I greatly appreciate his commitment to this new lifestyle since I am sure that the transition was shocking to him at the start. I would have great difficulty only having a few good sturdy pieces of clothing instead of my current closet. I would have no problem cleaning out my closet, but I do enjoy fashion and would miss putting together variations of outfits.

After reading Thoreau’s Walden I was shocked to see that it was published in 1854. Considering the fact that that these idea’s and beliefs he is trying to express seem more relevant to our current time. Maybe if this book had been taken more literally then we wouldn’t be so worried about this now. I think most of America can agree that everyone would benefit from simplifying our lives. In response to Professor Hiltner, I personally think Thoreau would be surprised to see how far industrialization and modern technologies have taken us. I think he would be disappointed to see how much waste has been accumulated after all this time. We live in a world that is ruled by money so that we can buy things that we think will make life better. Society is in this loop where we live to work. I think many people can relate (including myself) that we tend to buy things because it’s what everyone has or what everyone “should have”. This leads us to caring more about what others think of us, and not actually caring about the product itself. Thoreau says that this makes us a “slave to ourselves”. I honestly had never really thought about it this way. Of course I have thought about my consumption and I have known that buying in excesses or buying for gratification is unhealthy. But to have it said like that made me think about it on a deeper level. Honestly, I became rather disappointed in myself when I looked around to see that even though I have known better I still fall victim to consumerism. Something I really liked in this first chapter was when he talked about breaking out of our comfort. I think this is why so many people fall victim to consumerism like I do. Another quote that stood out to me was “the life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind”. In other words the life we live now of working and buying is not the only way of life. I think its important to understand that just because this is the life we all see doesn’t mean we have to live that way. Thoreau explains that by breaking from this mindset we can actually gain more beneficial life experiences. I thought this was a great read and a powerful piece of literature that is very relevant now.  
 <br><br>

With that said I do think that because I am privileged making these lifestyle changes are possible. Some need to work to support their families. Some don’t have the luxury of time that is needed to make this type of change. I think we need to talk about how we can make these changes more realistic for everyone.

After reading Walden, I completely admire Thoreau's lifestyle of minimalism. I believe that the more materialistic things we have results in us just wanting more and more as this little "thing" we once bought had sparked a little bit of happiness. We then tend to rely on buying more to complete our happiness. However, in reality, if we just do not have the desire to want more then we will be happy in the first place. Being satisfied with what we already have is the true key to happiness and if we live a life out of necessity instead or luxury we will actually be much happier since we do not feel we are missing pieces. After taking a class of Buddhism I have learned a lot about how to achieve happiness or in their case Nirvana and it actually starts off with desires. By wanting things we can't have we become sad but if we do not want them in the first place we will not be sad. We must be content with what we have and our happiness can only elevate from there.

 <br><br>

Thoreau argues that having a simple life with just the necessities by showing the reader he built a small home for himself, lived a vegan lifestyle, wore only minimal pieces of clothing and showed us that this is really all you need. I completely agree with this and I believe that if everyone lives such a simple life we would not be blinded by the things that truly matter or make us happy such as moments with friends and family. As a result, appreciating these moments also does not cost us the environment such as materialistic items such as fast fashion clothing that only brings us momentarily bursts of happiness. Walden being written in the 19th century just shows how prompt we should be with trying to mitigate climate change. The fact that even during that time Thoreau was criticizing consumption, means we should act fast.

I agree with your take completely. A simple lifestyle can bring an abundance of happiness. I have seen many examples of people living in less developed countries living simple lives finding great joy in small things. Being able to be content with what you have is a key aspect in trying to live this way. Putting less emphasis on owning material items and not longing for more is difficult to do in this day and age, but it is necessary if one is trying to lead a simple, minimalist life like Thoreau did while living in that cabin. 

 <br><br>

Not only would living like this be good for the soul but it would be good for our planet too. Obviously this lifestyle is not for everyone, but I think if people to some degree cut back on materialism this world would be better for it.

After reading this article, I learned that Walden wanted to express the probability of a simple life. The author described his self-sufficiency and his daily communication with farmers and neighbors. It is precisely because of experiencing the life of farmers, the author understands the difficulties of farmers' life, so he thinks that the luxurious life of the rich is meaningless, and severely criticizes this kind of behavior. He thinks that people use some luxury goods to satisfy themselves and bring the so-called comfort of life, which is completely unnecessary, and luxury goods have a great obstacle to human progress. I personally agree with Walden's point of view. But in today's society, this way of life is very difficult to survive. In today's society, a person's wealth and lifestyle all represent a person's success or not. Therefore, most people will pursue so-called happiness to earn more money to meet their material needs. Although these things are not really needed, they can meet their vanity. This kind of psychology hinders the progress of human beings, and demands and wastes too much for some things. What we need now is far more than what we need for survival. A lot of resources are wasted, resulting in resource shortage and environmental pollution. And it's going to get worse.

Thoreau is right. Being over-saturated with things will only lead to being consistently unsatisfied.

 <br><br>

When I saw that Ken was having us read this chapter of “Walden,” I was stoked. In high school, I had an issue with clothes. When I was unsatisfied with my life, or felt as if there was something missing, I decided that the thing that I was missing in my life is that one clothing item that I didn’t have. Once I had that particular item, all of my problems would be solved and I would be the person I was supposed to be. This made no sense and I knew it, but for some reason this always happened. Each time, when I got the shirt in the mail, I felt good for a day and then the feeling disappeared and I was back at square one. Then, every few months or so, I donated a bunch of clothes I didn’t wear anymore to the thrift store because I realized that I really did not need as many white tank tops as I thought I did.

 <br><br>

We read “Walden '' in my high school English class, and it deeply resonated with me. As we discussed the concepts of consumerism and minimalism that Thoreau exemplified in “Economy,” I understood exactly what he was trying to say. Nothing will ever fulfill you like living your life to the fullest will: hiding behind material possessions and allowing that to build who you are is not going to satisfy you in the end. You will always want more, and you will waste your time trying to grow covered in the unnecessary materials that you hold on to. At that time, though I had a weird shopping coping mechanism, I still connected with this piece. Other than clothes, I have never owned that many things. My room in high school never collected too many “knick-knacks,” and I never cared to upgrade my devices or constantly buy new beauty products etc. all the time. After reading this book, and also my vegan lifestyle nagging at me to stop buying jeans every time I got sad, I decided it was really time to find different ways to deal with things.

 <br><br>

Now, I like to think I live a pretty minimalistic lifestyle. I don’t really buy that many things, my room in college has the same decorations and furniture I had in my room in high school. My room now is incredibly small, and besides my bed, my closet and my bedside table, there aren’t that many things in there. I buy the groceries that I need, because to be honest I can’t afford to buy random snacks for no reason, and I cook at home the majority of the time. 
 <br><br>


In this critical time, as we face the possibility of a massive shift in our climate, thought pieces such as “Walden” are important to digest and reflect on. Though written in 1854, this consumerist society is still relevant today, showing us how deep our addiction to materialism is.

While reading Thoreau's piece, I found the knowledge he had gained from living a sedentary lifestyle extremely interesting, but also based a lot about the hidden fact that he had a lot of privilege to be able to do so. While it is extremely fascinating and it is something that I find compelling, the minimalist movement really is centered around how privileged one is to be able to fulfill this lifestyle. It meant he did not have to work for two years for a family he had to feed and was able to leave without much distress. I think it really just comes down to accessibility. While all of these methods of minimalism seem extremely doable, most of the time it really is not. After one develops an "arsenal" of minimalist centered goods, then it is easy. But getting to the point of discarding things is extremely difficult, especially if financially one is not able to suddenly leave their life. Again, I agree with the minimalist lifestyle and leaving a lavish lifestyle in the past, but it is something that not every person can pursue. When speaking about solutions to climate change, I think its important to not think of sudden changes because it really is not easy to give up goods, even though less goods would mean less money being spent. That is not always the case. My parents are vegetarian and I for many years practiced being vegetarian, and it really was not difficult at all. But the one thing I did notice is that the vegan lifestyle is not affordable for the struggling American family. Again, I completely agree with the vegan lifestyle and conforming to that culture, but there needs to be a means to fulfill that lifestyle that is more accessible than cheap and easy fast food that many families rely on. Those families probably do wish they could also be eating healthy and vegan, but it is just so difficult when corporations and money are beginning to monopolize something as simple as being vegan. I hope Ken speaks about the minimalist lifestyle more because I would love to learn more methods to implement it on a low budget!

I could not agree more! I think you have brought up such a valid point. Hopefully Ken can talk about specific ways to make this more applicable for all in the up coming lectures.


<br><hr>

I completely agree. It is so counterintuitive and frustrating that new lifestyle changes are being made increasingly unaffordable. I love the way you put it, that “corporations and money are beginning to monopolize something as simple as being vegan”. It is counterintuitive in that veganism is literally eating from the Earth. It cuts out the processing step of food and, by nature, requires less work to get food from farm to table. But, seeing that it is becoming “hip and trendy '', big corporations are beginning to realize that they can profit off lifestyle changes and are making it unattainable. It is so frustrating that people who have every intention in the world to do what's best for their body and the planet are unable to because an average trip to Whole Foods will put someone back at least $50, while a trip to McDonalds will only be about $5. Minimalism and a healthy life should not be more expensive than rampant consumerism. Buying in bulk for much cheaper from Costco deters people from going to their local farmers market and patronizing local merchants. So, the main takeaway from Walden is spot on, that we need to minimize as a society and keep only what we need, but this is easier said than done, unless change comes from the top. We need policy to encourage sustainable and healthy choices and no longer let big corporations dictate our diets and lifestyles.
<br><hr>
 you brought up an interesting perspective that I hope professor Ken can address in the following weeks. Yeah, I do agree with how there must be a sense of privilege to be able to go out and live that extreme minimalism lifestyle. I agree with your point on how the vegan lifestyle does not go well with every socioeconomic status. I was talking to my friend today about switching to a non meat diet. However, we concluded at this moment it would be too difficult to not eat meat due to how it is cheaper and more filling. In addition, it is more accessible with fast foods serving it but making their salads $9. Yeah, I did not consider how really easy it was for Henry to just leave for two years to life that life. I don’t think most people could pull that off. Yeah, I do agree that sudden changes won’t help the environment issue. I think it should be a slow change to really keep that lifestyle continuing. I really hope Ken talks more about low budget earth friendly methods as well.

<br><hr>
your idea of Thoreau’s background is interesting to me. I have never thought of it when I was reading the text. Yes, practicing minimalism will help humans to eliminate waste and pollutants to the environment, but it may not be a practical way for all families. Referring to Ken’s video, he mentioned that people are unable to give up the privilege of having a car. In America’s society, a car is necessary for traveling to work and maintain daily needs as public transportation is not convenient in most places. In this case, each car can generate tons of greenhouse gases which end up in the environment. Not every family can choose to live in the woods like Thoreau did. Undoubtlessly, living a minimalist lifestyle helps in eliminating waste in the clothing industry. But the opportunity cost of adapting to this lifestyle is too much for one to choose to be a minimalist rather than a living lavishly. In my opinion, in order to encourage more people in saving resources. The government must implement policy which compel the citizens to follow (like recycling) or to reward them for doing so. Certainly, the government must focus on setting pollution limit to enterprises.

I’ll be the first to say that in reading (in my opinion) somewhat ambiguous and metaphorical writings such as Walden, that I often get lost of the intended meaning. I also must acknowledge that we as human beings see what we want to see and find convenience to our issues in any given text. That all said, what I most took from Walden was his echoing suggestion that in spending the majority of our lives making money to live finely in the future, proves to be facetious, as we ‘wake up’ decades of labor later and have wasted away all of our best time unnecessarily. The second influential section, laid in Walden’s reference to the conversation with a farmer declares “You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with”, yet his oxen do just such. Modern day, this applies to the vegetarianism movement’s counterargument that meat is essential to survival. Open your eyes to other beings… it is not. After writing all this, I got to the clothing portion of the text. Walden states the truth point blank; we do not need as many clothes as we have and do not even give a proper lifetime to the ones we do, all for aesthetics and society. He is right, 100% completely right, but as someone who loves fashion that can’t always be supported by second-hand or what I already have, AH ! Walden is right, and this is hard… All said about myself, I respect a great deal Walden’s undertaking and lifestyle choices. I wish I lived in a world where I could believe a life like that is possible, maybe even realistic.

In the economic part, the author takes the living conditions of people in Concord as an example and asks the following questions: Is it necessary for people to work endlessly, and can this situation be improved? The author believes that people are usually driven by the so-called "must" as fate to accumulate wealth. Most people are filled with anxiety and run like machines endlessly. But in fact, what we pursue in our work is only to satisfy our vanity, luxury, and insatiable desire, rather than what we really need in the essence of life. Like now, many people go to college holding the purpose of finding a good job and making money (including me), which is exactly what the author criticized.
 <br><br>
Life needs “heat” to be maintained. Thoreau believes that human clothing, food, and housing solve the problem of life “heat,” which does not need too much cost to obtain. Some people, however, went to the other half of the earth and did business for ten or twenty years, in order to live - that is, to make them comfortable and warm - and finally died in New England. Luxury people are not only pursuing a comfortable and warm life, but also unnatural desires.
 <br><br>
Simple, independent, honest and free are Thoreau's survival ideas in the economic chapter. He tries to evoke modern people who are addicted to the maze of desire, awaken our deep sleeping rational soul, let us reexamine what is the meaning of life and accomplished, and think about a new kind of survival way.

I agree that the economic topic that he discussed was very interesting. He said we go to college in order to get a better job, but he has tried this and he is better off without. He also compared this to living situations, that at “Those conveniences which the student requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great a sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides.” I found this very interesting because he compared all the money we spend to the minimal money he is spending for what he believes is a better life. On this point another economic thing I found interesting is how he constantly compared the typical of using resources to get things done that he can do on his own. He stated that he needs no animals to farm his food, another thing that really stood out to me is transportation. He said someone who takes a quick way of transportation could take him less time by foot. He says this is possible, because while the person must work to afford the train ect. He can take that full day of work and walk there in less time. This really interested me because it strikes the society that we live in now that wants everything to happen as fast as possible and we think that time is money. But we often forget that the money spent to take the faster way could’ve saved us time in the long run. 
 <br><br>

The 4 survival ideas that you pointed out are Thoreau's focus are very accurate. Every argument he seemed to of made leads back to one of these points. When I was trying to think of additional survival ideas I came up with his desires. He stated he was able to live off of 6 weeks work and sustain everything he desired with his own hands. But this just goes back to one of the main points of simplicity. I think through these four ideas you are easily able to wrap up Thoreau's lifestyle and what minimalist means in his eyes.

After reading Walden for English 22 and after reviewing "Economy" for this class, I can appreciate Thoreau's challenge to the status quo. While he only lived at Walden pond for two years, I think the demonstration that it could be done and the influence on environmental movement were the most important things to come out of it. Do I believe that this book will have people living in boxes that they find at the rail road? No, but I do think it causes the reader to yearn for a life that is more simplistic. Today's world is a non stop onslaught of tasks and work to be done, and a culture that tells us to buy everything in sight and more. This chaos and utter disrespect for ourselves and the environment is good cause to want to want to simplify and Thoreau taps into that want. 

 <br><br>

I think that there are some issues with Thoreau's work such as the fact that this model of someone who was well off who downsized leaves a lot of questions. What are the implications for those who do not have the means to necessarily start a life like this? What about people with families? I think that the idea of type of living is appealing to some but ultimately will not satisfy all walks of life (where they are unable or chose to forego this lifestyle). Another issue I have that was brought up in English 22 is that this book encourages people en mass to move to pristine and remote places. Once people move to these places they will ultimately be exploited and destroyed. I am all for having eco-friendly and more minimalist living and I try to manifest these ideals into my everyday life; however, I think that the focus should be on places we already have such as cities. I think it far more effective to revamp and rethink already urbanized places. Things like eco apartments, green top roofs, more mass transit, closer permaculture/farming, etc are all ways we can improve an already damaged environments. But, if we follow Thoreau's advice directly I fear that not only will urbanized areas continue to be unhealthy environments, but that pristine environments will see a downfall as well. 

 <br><br>

Overall Thoreau's message of living simply is a great one and I think everyone should take that message to heart. I also think it is important to be mindful of how we interpret Thoreau so we continue to be environmental stewards rather than pastoral hopefuls who ignore the problems at hand and flee away to decimate more pristine environments.

Henry David Thoreau would be horrified by the average lifestyle of people in present day America. Obviously, the luxurious habits of the 1% would shock him, but even the “minimalist” lifestyle that some people choose today would seem excessive to him. Thinking about the ways Thoreau simplified his life is partly disheartening, because I don’t think it would even be possible to live like he did at Walden in the 21st century. The way property and resources have been valued make it more difficult to follow his example. I can’t think of anywhere one could live (in even as small a home as he did) that wouldn’t be considered trespassing, let alone a site in nature that hasn’t been made uninhabitable by climate change. Like you said, maybe moving into a Thoreau-style house in the middle of nowhere isn’t applicable today, but moving to a city definitely is. Looking at Walden through a present-day lens, the urbanized world seems to be a good place to start applying Thoreau’s ideas today. 
 <br><br>

Thinking relative to my own life as a college student, applying the broader concepts and messages of Walden could be feasible and probably more fulfilling than the life I have been conditioned to value. Moving out of my own bedroom with a closet full of stuff into a tiny dorm with two other people has made me realize the many things that I can live without. But even though I have gotten used to living with a fraction of the space and belongings that I had before, I still find myself being heavily influenced by consumer culture and hyper-capitalism. This reading made me think about the many purchases I have made, and if they made me happy because they bettered my personal life and brought me inner satisfaction, or if I was just excited to show them off and have the same material things that the people around me had. Henry David Thoreau’s message towards the end of the chapter that we should not try to save the world after throwing away materialism is applicable to the ways we address climate change today. He emphasizes the importance of inner spiritual perfection, which is not exactly the most pressing issue in the middle of the climate crisis, however, finding peace and happiness in minimalism is an important element of living sustainably. We can’t just try to replace all the material things valued in society with sustainable options, we must revamp capitalist culture and switch to valuing a more simplistic lifestyle. When people can discard materialism and find happiness and satisfaction living with only (or just mostly) the essentials, there will be far less obstacles in the way of climate action.

After reading your comment, I would say I agree with you completely. I had a very similar response to this reading and I really enjoyed reading what you had to say about it. You and Ken, in this lecture video, both confirmed that Thoreau's experience of living at the Walden Pond for two years is capable of inspiring his readers to become more accepting of a "simple" life. I laughed when you admitted that you think the text, although convincing, wouldn't inspire people to live "in boxes they find at the railroad." I second that thought for sure. I also see the modern world as an everlasting list of things to do, to be, and possessions to want/need. Our society was become centered around consumerism and has redefined the word success along the way. Just as you said, Thoreau taps in to the harm we are causing in our lives, on future generations, and our environment. 
 <br><br>

I also thought you had a very interesting point about the restrictions Thoreau's lifestyle would have on our society today. I find it hard to believe that our society, one so centered around commercialism and the consumer way, would be able to switch to minimalism and rural living in the extreme sense, like Thoreau suggests in "Walden". Sure, this lifestyle will sound appealing to some and may benefit those who attempt it, but I do not see it satisfying everyone and therefore having a lasting impact on our current situation. You brought up a great point that if people actually did move to the remote, rural areas that are left, they would soon become exploited and destroyed. We should make use of our growing cities and instead of moving away from them, turn them into a more eco-friendly and minimalist style living place. I found this to be very insightful and I support your idea to expand on or "revamp" our already urbanized areas, instead of instilling more harm on what is left of our environment.

It's amazing to think that their was already thought out plans for the future in regards to the lifestyles we have and how they could be changed for the better. It was quite interesting to think that even in the 19th century their were ideas and challenges that were aware of how a simplistic way of living would be the best and healthiest way of living on earth. I believe Thoreau's Warden would be astonished, frightened, and disappointed at the way we are living now. The world would be a much more pleasant habitat if we took on the Thoreau's challenge.  I believe Ken's right in saying that in order to save this planet we'd have to deplete ourselves from having the lavish lifestyles that older generations had in order to secure this planet and take a step back in order to leave room for other generation for a healthier future or nonetheless a future at all.It might not be the fairest option we have but it's one that will surely impact the planet in a positive way and if that's what it's going to take then by all means i'm all for it.

As I  was reading Thoreau's Walden, I was also surprised to see the parallel between his recommendations and the advice being given now in order to reduce global temperatures. He writes that society is too preoccupied with the idea of living to buy material items rather than living for happiness. A huge point that we looked at this week is the fact that too many Americans are concerned with owning inanimate objects in order to show off their social status: the more stuff someone has, the wealthier they are. Additionally, Thoreau encourages the society of his time to live in smaller homes, purchase less clothing, and consume less meat in order to combat their materialist lifestyle, while today's society promotes the idea of tiny houses, thrifting, and a vegan/vegetarian diet as solutions to the growing climate change problem. It is amazing to see that completely different circumstances can prompt similar solutions.
 <br><br>

One idea that I think needs to be looked at more closely is his idea that "the finest qualities of our nature … can be preserved only by the most delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly." Thoreau is attempting to illustrate to others that simply being kind and accepting is a possible solution to the problem. In his context he proposes this idea as a way to make people happier; however, I believe that this can assist with our climate situation as well. Too many people see the climate crisis as a political/social problem: they think that if someone believes in climate change, they can't be friends and vice versa, but I think if we all accepted each other and our beliefs, we could make a bigger change. We should be finding a way to work together, not fight each other.

I do agree with what Thoreau has to say. Society has become so infatuated with looking like they have money. We've been taught that a certain lifestyle is what we should strive for. Good paying job, big house, and a big family. There's nothing wrong with having a good paying job but the real issue is the big house and family. The family size isn't really touched on but it is a cause to buy a bigger house and buy more goods. Thoreau says to do what you want to do for work which makes sense but in today's society we need better paying jobs to be able to pay for the bare minimum. In terms of house size having a larger house seems more desirable from a comfort standpoint but from a financial and conversational viewpoint it isn't worth the cost. You pay for more space that you may not use 100% of the time. It also takes up land that isn't our's, destroying the ecosystem and removing animals from their habitats. I know it would be hard to get everyone on board but I do believe my generation could make it happen. I'm just afraid it would take a very long time. Minimalism is idealistic but it isn't realistic. People will want to spend their money and want to buy everything new. That is just the unfortunate truth of society there will always be that small group of people to mess everything up.

I definitely agree with you on the various points you made. When I was reading this piece from Thoreau and he stated that everyone was wearing and buying clothes not because they necessary needed them, but because they cared so much about what their neighbors would think of them. Today's society is no different than what it was in the 19th century, except now we have more advanced technology which makes it easier to purchase and want more materialistic things, and bigger houses. There truly is no real need for such lavish things but many people from what I have seen have the mentality of asking themselves: how else will I let others know that I am well off? We as a society, especially in America, want to show off and use what they have worked hard for and they do that by buying bigger houses, buying more clothes, having multiple cars, etc. that greatly increases their carbon intake and damages our world.
 <br><br>
I do think that our generation could make a difference but it would definitely be very difficult battling with the mentality of needing these unnecessary luxuries. And I definitely fear that if we do manage to change this view perhaps it will be too late.

I have read this chapter before, but never really saw it through a climate crisis perspective. I saw it as something important for oneself to feel more spiritually and physically better. But now in this class, I can relate Thoreau’s strong ideas to the dangerous climate crisis we have created as humans. Thoreau advocates for a simple lifestyle to help oneself gain a better understanding of the world and to leave behind the lavish and unnecessary desires we center our lives around. But looking at his work through a climate change perspective is also interesting. As Ken mentioned, Thoreau desires humans to rewrite their roles and not subconsciously act in the ways they were born into. Looking at the climate crisis now, I can see how rewriting our roles and desires is extremely crucial and can drastically fix the climate crisis. If every person takes the necessary steps to make their lifestyles more simple, we can hopefully mitigate the crisis. For example, walking or biking to school rather than buying a lavish and unnecessarily expensive car can contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Also, not buying into the consumer culture we live in by buying less clothes can do the same. Another important change is changing one’s lifestyle from a meat-eating one to vegetarianism. Although this is difficult, it can help the issue of the climate crisis by a lot. For me, this is very difficult, so I have been reducing the amount of meat I eat, and I stay away from beef as much as possible (sticking with chicken for the most part). 
 <br><br>


Thoreau saw the value of fighting the societal systems we live in and are a part of by making our lives more simple and more meaningful. There are so many benefits to this lifestyle, from helping our earth to helping ourselves understand our point in life. Fighting back and not getting trapped in the desires associated with a lavish lifestyle might be difficult, so taking small steps is a great way to help the earth. No action is absolute, doing small actions is great on its own and should be seen as an accomplishment. If we all made our lives more simple in some ways, we would be able to help our earth to a great extent.

Before I dive into one of Thoreau's arguments in the first chapter in his book, I want to emphasize a claim that Ken makes towards the end of this video. Ken mentions how his generation (and also ours) is living a luxurious lifestyle which in a hierarchal society such as ours has long been seen as the end goal; canonically known as the American Dream. However, Ken argues that despite all of the material benefits of living this lifestyle it has not necessarily contributed to our happiness. I believe that that is the case because living a consumerist lifestyle has taught us to never be satisfied and take for granted the items we already own. Think about companies such as apple that release a new phone every one to two years. As consumers, despite already having a functional phone, we are driven to buy a new one because we know there now exists a "superior" option of an item we already own. Since we are never satisfied with the number of items we obtain and there are plenty of other people in the world who own more things than we do, we are never truly happy with the lifestyles we lead.

 <br><br>

This is not only true for material items but also with social media. Every day we see celebrities and even acquaintances or friends buy new items and it drives us to want what they have newly acquired. In addition, since everyone has a tendency to post their "best life" on social media sites such as Instagram and we are social creatures that have the habit of constantly comparing ourselves to others, we feel like our lifestyles are insignificant compared to that false reality that is projected by others. Since we are aware of our own problems and social media usually does not show the negative aspects of people's lives, it creates a divide between the platform and the user, leading to unhappiness. I would also argue that even being aware of this dynamic does not prevent us from subconsciously suffering from its adverse effects. Let's take depression as an example to make an analogy of this situation. A depressed person can definitely be aware of his/her condition and understand what he/she can do to mitigate it. However, does he/she being aware of their condition allows him/her to move past it? No, a lot more work has to be put in for he/her to overcome this barrier. Similarly, although we can reach the conclusion that most people post their best lives on Instagram, it doesn't necessarily mean that we aren't affected negatively by this trend as we see it over and over again as we scroll past social media.

 <br><br>

To me, it seems like society has become a competition. Success has become measured by how well off people are because of monetary gain and the number of assets and items they own, not by how happy and productive they have become.
 <br><br>


Thoreau's work really resonated with me because despite having written his book 150 years ago, the points he makes are very applicable today. For instance, Thoreau mentions that "whatever, of all that man obtains by his own exertions [...] has become, so important to human life that few, if any, whether from savageness, or poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it”. In this quote, Thoreau is criticizing his neighbors for holding on so tightly to their material belongings when they don't really need them to survive. He remarks that those items have become an indispensable part of their lifestyles and none of them could probably ever imagine living without them. What fascinates me is that this quote still holds true today. We build our identities based on the items we own and use and most of us really couldn't imagine living a rudimentary lifestyle in the wild similar to Thoreau.
 <br><br>


In an article conducted by Quartz Africa in 2017 titled "Some of the world's most unhappy countries are the most optimistic", one of the main points made in the article is that despite Africa's low rating of happiness among its inhabitants due to poor living standards, it is one of the most optimistic countries. According to the article, this is because "This positive expectation of the future is also buoyed by the resolution that happiness is not just a personal project, but a social one" and goes on to talk about the collectivist values that are rooted in African culture and how they largely contribute to the population's happiness. In my opinion, if Africa, despite its poor infrastructure and lack of water and electricity can be one of the most optimistic countries, then we can be too even if we abandon our lavish lifestyles like Thoreau. As the article mentions, happiness is also deeply rooted in social constructs we have with other individuals, not necessarily by how many items we own.

I completely agree with all the points you made in your comment. It does feel like society has become a competition and I feel like (I mentioned this in another comment too) it's a result of living in a society where capitalism has essentially taken over. Because of it we are constantly bombarded with the newest, trendiest products and overwhelmed with images of celebrities and other on social media being happy and "living their best life." It can create a lot of pressure within people to do everything they can to do the same. It just now occurred to me that a vast majority of advertisements are meant to make you feel anxious, for lack of better word, about being left out by not having the trendiest products/clothes. The thing is, as it's been mentioned, having more stuff does not make us happy. We are just continuously trying to fill a void with stuff but instead of feeling more fulfilled or happy we end up feeling more isolated from others. 
 <br><br>

As I was reading "Walden," I found that so much of it is very much applicable to our contemporary society. The quote Ken mentioned in his video about clothing and Americans being monkeys who follow Paris is a quote that particularly stuck out to me. Fast fashion in recent years has made us feel that we constantly need to be buying clothes to be in with the latest trend and encourages us to throw out clothes that  would still otherwise be usable. In reality we don't really need all those new articles of clothing--we get them because we think it'll make us feel more fulfilled or keep us up with the latest trend. It sucks that companies/corporations exploit that social anxious and FOMO for their own monetary gain and at the cost of the environment too.
 <br><br>

Moreover, the more I think about the more I really like the idea of consuming less and consuming more consciously. I'll definitely do my best to start being more thoughtful in the way that I consume and what exactly it is that I'm consuming.

<br><hr>

Yeah, it’s crazy how his work continues to be applicable today, and perhaps even more important. For me personally, it just really sad to see someone place material belongings above other things that should be more important like one’s mental health. We’ve been taught at a young age that more is better and that if we don’t have a lot of things that we are bound to be unhappy. It’s scary how brainwashed we as a society have become under this misconception. I agree that social media plays a huge role in this dilemma. The constant ads everything that we are constantly bombarded with are designed to make us feel inadequate or as if something is missing. This kind of thinking is what makes it hard for us to be satisfied with what we have. Even when we do buy new things, we just as quickly throw them out because they’re out of style or their purpose has already been fulfilled. Although it is a great thing that fashion has become a way to express oneself, it becomes a problem when we buy more for no reason.

<br><hr>
I whole-heartedly agree with each of your statements above. If anything, I feel as though our mass consumption and luxurious style of living has lessened our happiness. Depression rates are fairly high in the U.S., despite our country being quite well off. All of this points to the concept "less is more." In a film I watched about fast fashion, a key point was made: "nice"  (aka stylish but cheaply made) clothing is becoming increasingly cheap, with stores like Forever 21 being a prime example. The film goes on to say that we continuously buy things to feel as though we are rich; to feel as though we can afford nice clothing. In reality we are buying poorly made clothes for a brief moment of happiness. I think this directly correlates with our homes being bigger, along with other aspects of consumerism and the lives of Americans. We want these bigger homes to display our wealth, which in turn displays our "happiness." But, this is not the case. Many of the people who have the most "stuff" also have higher rates of depression. 
 <br><br>

Moving on from this, an aspect of the reading I found particularly interesting was the passage about the elderly. Thoreau goes into great detail commenting on those in generations preceding your own. He speaks of their past actions as failures, and says that we must learn from our own experiences, not theirs. This made me directly think about the generation that caused climate change. More specifically, how they won't address what needs to be done to fix. It almost felt as if Thoreau was speaking out about this... 
 <br><br>
I have to agree. Though I am in no way "hating on" Ken's generation, I plan on living a life very different from theirs. I don't need mass quantities of the essentials to be happy; I need the minimal amount. I find myself most at peace when I am in possession of fewer things, and in a smaller space of my own. 
 <br><br>

This correlates with Thoreau's ideas of living utilizing only the bare necessities. As I read this, I found myself thinking about how Thoreau was largely ahead of his time. If someone from his time period can acknowledge the absurdness of owning things in mass quantities and simply wanting to have everything new, then anyone in our own time period should be able to as well.
<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading your response and I absolutely agree with you. The tragic part of our society is that no matter how many things we have, we will never be satisfied. It is an endless cycle that leads to rampant consumerism, which has detrimental effects on the environment and our wallets, which leads to unhappiness. I agree with you when you said that success is measured by our things and our money instead of our happiness. If our society was able to lead a more minimalistic lifestyle, in my opinion, America would be a happier, more optimistic country. Unfortunately, because of our capitalistic economy and our eagerness to achieve the American Dream, this will probably not happen.  
 <br><br>

Something that personally resonated with me was when Thoreau stated that, "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation." I think this is a very important point, just like Ken's regarding how a materialistic lifestyle does the opposite of contributing to a happy life. Ultimately, through the reading, the movie, and the lecture, it has become clear to me that the best way to escape this reality is to drastically simplify our lives. Thoreau, through the use of this quote, is encouraging people to follow his example by opting for life away from the city. While I do believe that spending time outside and taking breaks from our fast-paced society is important, if everyone packed their things and ran away from this, there would still be problems. America needs to address this. I personally think that the best way for this to happen is for celebrities and politicians to inspire Americans into purchasing less stuff and spending more time in nature. If we were more focused in living in the moment instead of stressing about the future, I think our nation would be much more satisfied.


<br><hr>

I completely agree with your claim that "society has become a competition". It has, and it's all based off the materialistic things that these people possess. People portray a total different life on social media than in actual reality. From what I've seen from other people's experiences is that social media is a way of escaping reality, because they aren't happy with their reality. This often leads people to make a fantasy of a life they wish they had. This isn't because it genuinely makes them happy, but most people feel like they need a sense of validation from others in their life. It's pointless, because some of the times people are in essence trying to impress the people that don't even like or care for them. 
 <br><br>
 When you mention that Thoreau criticized his neighbors for caring too much about their materialistic possession is very eye catching when taking into account that this was the mindset he had back in the 19th century. He understood, unlike many people, that all one needed was the bare essentials. This shows that he was way ahead of his time, because even today, many people don’t understand that valuing materialistic things isn’t the key to happiness. But as you brought up how the article by Quartz Africa mentions, “happiness is also deeply rooted in social constructs we have with other individuals, not necessarily by how many items we own.”. I completely agree with this claim, because we humans are social creatures, and we are nothing without each other. Also because we work better collectively as a group as opposed to individually.
<br><hr>

I 100% agree with your comment. Watching the video, my thoughts instantly turned towards social media as well. I think the posting of expensive, lavish objects does nothing but fuel peoples desires to get them. One influencer who comes to mind for this behavior would be Dan Bilzerian. His instagram feed is full of pictures of him and yachts or private jets flying to exotic parts of the world. The reality is that 99% of people will  never be able to experience this lifestyle. As a result, it simply works to make people jealous and unhappy with their own lives. Out of curiosity, I once watched a podcast with Dan Bilzerian. He said that all his incredible utilities do little to bring him happiness. Everyone believes that having all the money in the world will make their lives perfect, but little do they know that it can do no such thing. I find it remarkable that Thoreau had the foresight to understand such a long time ago. When I first read his work when I was younger, I didn't really understand his message. Now that I am older, I see just how wise he truly is.
<br><hr>
I absolutely agree with your statement above. Your observations and statements are completely valid and I enjoyed reading it. “The American Dream” has been apart of our society for as long as I remember. I believe my whole life revolves around this American dream because I was taught that going to school, receiving an education and degree will help me establish a well paying job. Money is everything in this society and we would not be able to survive without it but it does not equal to a happy and stress free life. Instead, this materialistic and luxurious lifestyle has had a negative impact in our world. I agree with your statement that living in such a consumerist lifestyle has taught us to be ungrateful and unsatisfied with what does surround us. We are constantly surrounded by ads, deals and famous people that ultimately release a false perception that if you own this item you will be the happiest on the planet. 
 <br><br>

Society has become a competition. Every individual for their own; people scams others in order to become more successful. I remember watching “A True Cost” which is a film about the fashion industry which states that living like a minimalist does not mean to just live a completely basic life, it encourages individuals to keep things/items that make them happy and cause joy but throw away the things that are not being used or are unnecessary. The more items you have does not equal to how successful or happy you are. These ideas and mentality are destroying the planet because if we keep striving for the latest iPhone, most expensive car, how many cars can we own and newest fashion means we are contributing to the fossil fuels that production factories are using to pollute the air.
<br><hr>
I think you started out your comment very well addressing out own generation and our faults in being overly materialistic and overly competitive. We are so hypnotized by the phrase that "newer is better" and we change the material things that we won and give into consumerism. We are consumers of the fashion industry, technology industry, etc. Despite the fact that we already own enough for us to use, enough for us to wear, we continue to buy new things whenever they come out to follow the "trend". The trend is to want new things. Your example with social media, how celebrities and influencers use their platform to advertise their brand and the brands they signed with, hits the exact point. Social media spreads  media advertisement to our phones, where we carry everywhere, instead of just in our television 15 to 20 years ago. I agree that social media is one of the reasons consumerism has risen and continues to rise.
 <br><br>
Our society has definitely become measured by success in monetary terms. All college students care about earning a six-figure salary within the least years of graduating, and accumulating enough money in order to buy some obscenely expensive thing. Many people waste their wealth on things that are not even needed. I think having a stable income is extremely important and vital, however, a part of me also agrees with Thoreau's point of reducing our material attachments.  Like Thoreau says, many of us have forgotten the true necessaries and means of life, and instead are chasing after something meaningless. The quote,  "mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country" also states an essential truth. We chase after our desperation to gain something, and when we gained that, we desperately chase for more.
 <br><br>
Instead, we should all strive for a life of simplicity in order to return to the basics of life, and truly remember the meaning and necessities that we should truly think about.
<br><hr>
I thought the most interesting quote in the chapter was "You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with"; and so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle." I think it most accurately represents the hypocrisy of society. We say things that aren't true and we surround ourselves with things that contradict that truth, but we don't recognize the BIG truth because we are selfish and our truths are more convenient for us. 
 <br><br>

I thought another interesting part of the chapter was how Thoreau emphasized how we follow the traditions and directions of our ancestors. But for what purpose? To repeat their mistakes? I think this relates to our current situation because we have to stray from following the traditions and directions of our ancestors, who have ruined the planet.
<br><hr>
I think it is really important to acknowledge that this typical definition of success as monetary gain, like you say, absolutely does not correlate to happiness. In Walden, Thoreau notes that "the mass of men live lives of quiet desperation". This quote really resonates because so many people try to fulfill themselves through consumerism that is detrimental to the environment to prove that they are more successful, but end up feeling even more empty. To Thoreau, "things" are of minimal importance and he attempts to live with only what he deems absolutely essential. I think that this attempt is admirable, but the reality is that Thoreau's support of the countryside lifestyle ended up having some negative effects on the environment. When a lot of people start moving to the countryside, they end up destroying some of it in the process. Furthermore, Thoreau is not actually solving problems in urban areas, simply leaving those problems behind, and criticizing people instead of offering realistic solutions. I think Thoreau does have some good points about societal issues, but is overall a bit hypocritical. After all, he did only live at Walden Pond for 2 years.
 <br><br>

A quote from Walden that applies to what you said about society becoming a competition is "Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have such a one as their neighbors have." Thoreau conveys that people are never satisfied because they are constantly comparing themselves to others, and think they need more than everyone else to be better. The real takeaway from Walden is similar to the main points in the documentary Minimalism: there is a threshold to how much happiness money and "things" can buy.

<br><hr>
I really enjoyed reading your comment because I feel like you hit a lot of good points both in the book and in Ken's video. I resonated heavily with Ken's analogy on the script and how it was written before we were even born. It's crazy because you really can't choose the life you're born into and what certain choices are yours. For example, the famous Kardashian Family got famous and their children born into that lavish lifestyle are put on them. From wearing designer clothes starting when they were born to flying a in private jet every week. They did not choose that lifestyle, they were simply born into it. Versus a family who grew up and was born into poverty. I really do agree with Ken when he says we need to rewrite the script, especially those who have the resources to do so. For example, Jaden Smith is contributing to the Flint Michigan issue going on right now. If everyone rewrites their own script to benefit each other, I don't think climate change would be an issue.

Unfortunately, mankind is cruel and greedy. As this comment says, everything is made to be more "superior" than the generation before and everyone always wants the newest thing. Well, except for a handful of people like Thoreau who is more suited for the simple life. It's easy to say "rewrite your own script," but in reality, everyone just wants the best thing for themselves. I'm sure that if third world countries have the resource to develop further, I'm sure they would jump at the chance. Similarly, the U.S. who ALREADY has the resources to further develope would not stop developing, they would just develope more and more. Like I said mankind is greedy and I genuinely don't think we as a society could do what Thoreau did. The book by Thoreau and Ken's video makes me realize that the phrase "Money doesn't/does buy happiness" is so controversial because of everyone's different scripts. In simple terms, society and mankind are constantly in a battle with themselves thus destroying our selves from within and our surroundings (the environment).

I completely agree that our consumerist culture has brought us nothing but dissatisfaction and unhappiness. I really like the example of Apple and their frequent release of iphones that you used. People like to buy updated and “superior” versions of things in order to feel good about owning the top tier versions. Excessive consumption is present in our society because we believe that is the best way to create happiness in our lives. I also agree with your statements on social media. Social media plays a huge part in spreading the consumerist lifestyle. I’m always seeing people posting all the new items they buy. When you see these types of things on social media it makes you want to buy new things as well because you see how “happy” it made someone else. This is the same thing with celebrities. They show off all their luxuries on social media and tell us how great their lives are due to all these things. 
 <br><br>

 Regarding your statement on society becoming a competition, it has always been like this and it will continue to be like that because we live in a country that prioritizes the economy and capital over everything else, including the well-being of our planet. 
 <br><br>

 Thoreau was indeed ahead of his time. It is crazy that he wrote a book so many years ago, but it goes perfectly with our current situation. Even back then, there was a fashion industry that deserved criticism and there was a consumerist culture that needed to be addressed. Of course now those things have only worsened. Thoreau was incredibly brave to perform an experiment like this, but to be fair I think it is safe to say it was much easier to do that in his time than it would be to do that now.


<br><hr>

I agree with the points you bring up in your first paragraph. The generation prior to us lived a luxurious lifestyle in a hierarchical community in pursuit of "The American Dream." Many members of our generation additionally strive to live the same way. Bigger is better. More is better. More stuff, more things, more consumption. Quantity is a quality of its own to us. But all this materialism isn't the true path to happiness. As Siddartha Gautama said, The origin of suffering is attachment. According to him, "the basic cause of suffering the attachment to the desire to have and the aversion to not having." In Walden, Thoreau's teachings say much of the same things. Reading Thoreau draws an interesting parallel to East/South Asian philosophies, namely Hindu and Buddhist schools of thought. Like many South Asian philosophers, Thoreau espoused vegetarianism. 
 <br><br>


To answer Ken's question, I believe that Thoreau would be Thoreau-ly disgusted with our current state of affairs. In the past 2 centuries, our consumerist culture has grown (like the size of our population) exponentially. I agree with something that one of my peers said about how college students are in a uniquely positioned to live a minimalistic lifestyle. We often live in a small room with other students ( I myself live in a less than 300 square foot room with two other students). That covers one aspect of the minimalistic lifestyle already, but we can certainly do more to live a minimalistic lifestyle. A quote I really liked from Walden was "Old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served his valet." I often see my friends buying excessive amounts of clothing and shoes that they sometimes seldom use. I was beginning to feel bad about only owning one pair of shoes when my roommates owned about 6-7 pairs of shoes each. However, this reading has reaffirmed my partial commitment to a minimalistic lifestyle.

<br><hr>

I completely agree with all the points made in the above comments. Our society has become obsessed with competing with one other with  the measure of success depending on who has the bigger house, who has the nicest car, who has the most expensive wardrobe. It's sad to think this is where we are in life. Especially, knowing that these materialistic items do not bring happiness into your life, on the contrary, because of this constant need to compete with everyone, you drain yourself out and at some point you ask yourself why am I living this way? 
 <br><br>
Although Thoreau did make some harsh comments towards our society, and some might take offense, he was not wrong. I find it admirable that Thoreau made it a mission to find the barest necessities needed for survival, demonstrating that everything else is just based on our cultural environment. I especially found interesting the list of material he bought to create his shelter and it cost him basically nothing compared to the big mansions and he was able to make a living out of his shelter for two years. After this book was released more people decided to do the same experiment as Thoreau which goes to show that there are people who are willing to completely shift their lives. And it's amazing that this book still falls within our world today despite being written 100 years ago. This needs to be a wake up call. We can no longer measure success by the amount of items we have or how expensive they are. We are better than that and need to change our ways.

<br><hr>
I agree with your statement, and I've been trying to make sure that I don't drown myself in stuff. All it results in is a less full bank account and a more cluttered space. Which is not a way to make yourself feel better. Social media is a very strong influencer in many people's lives and I am certain many people suffer from the adverse effects you've talked about. This is great for corporations: free advertisements that they aren't even aware of, but it's bad for the environment. The more people show what they buy, the more other people are influenced to buy it, creating more demand, resulting in an increase in supply which costs resources and damages the environment. We need to learn to let go of our attachments to the materials of this world and start holding on to, saving, the world itself. We can live without our iPhones, but we can't live without the Earth.

<br><hr>
I totally agree with your point on social media being an indirect contributor to climate change. It is quite frankly a place where people show off their best life that make others want more things that they do not have. I should know, because I am definitely guilty of looking at celebrities profiles and wanting their shoes, sunglasses, and random things that I already have, but just want a different or better version of. Sites like instagram, snapchat, and twitter have really embraced the consumerism side of the apps. Now there are ads enticing users to want to try the trendiest clothes, jewelry, and even socks with your dog's face on them.  All of these things are just temporary sources of happiness and then get tossed in the trash. However, their effects on climate change is not temporary. Coming to this realization that social media contributes to my excess want for more stuff is an important step in changing my lifestyle to be more sustainable. I hope others will also realize what social media is doing to not only our personal happiness, but to the planet.

<br><hr>
I agree in today's society happiness is mainly associated with money and things a person owns. We have developed a very materialistic society which is why I think climate change has been worsen, with things such as waste in the emission of greenhouse gases from big industries constantly producing to meet consumer demands besides profiting of course. Companies profit from people's insecurities of needing to be with the trend or have to show that one is successful through ownership of materialistic means. Instead of promoting being happy with fewer things, social media and companies are constantly promoting items making them seem that you need them. Such as with new fashion trends, with commercials portraying happy people going out in nice clothes, it tries to make the consumer think they would be happy as the people in the commerical if they had that as well.
<br><hr>
Your comment is well developed, and I am on your side without any doubt. One thing I want to continue to emphasize is the word "MATERIAL". Material, itself, is a symbol of our human civilization. As industry and technology advanced, humans created more and more fancy materials for different purposes. However, nowadays people value material differently, and lead to disaster of wasting resources unnecessarily. As a biology-major student, I understand that competition is the nature of life to obtain the opportunity of surviving. However, I do not think humans are still on the way of fighting nature, at least it is not happening in the U.S. Thus, we should reject our behavioral nature, and understand that the mainstream social media is false-leading on the topic of "material". As many of you guys commented, I agree that people post their stories on social media selectively, which they only post the "superior" side of their lives. This phenomenon promotes more people to join, and more resources were, is, and will be wasted. This is a "vicious circle"!
 <br><br>

In the article, the writer defined happiness very well. It is true that pursuing happiness is a lifestyle, but it does not mean wasting. The most important thing for us to do right now is to be satisfied. This sounds like a philosophical question right? But, we need to do it. Our world is great right? Think again, do you need everything in your house, probably not. You don't need the extra phone, extra bag, extra sunglasses. Why do you buy this? Because the advertisement of these brands are good? Or, you saw someone posted this on his or her instagram? We gotta stop this. Simply following the trend does NOT make you more superior, but only leads to waste of your money, and our resources.

<br><hr>
Thoreau's "Walden" creates such a stark contrast to the modern American lifestyle. We are raised to always be actively looking for an upgrade.  I see what you mean when you say that social media plays into this idea. Society has become  a competition, but it's been like that for as long as I know. For centuries, people have competed against each other to live a more comfortable lifestyle, and I think it is this problem that Thoreau is trying to address. At what point is too much? If I can get by living off of a 24 dollar house, there is no immediate reason why I should have to upgrade to anything more lavish. We have indeed become so attached to our worldly possessions. In many ways, they give our lives meaning and we do construct our identities based off of what and how much we own.
 <br><br>

Thoreau's metaphor with the hibernating frozen snake and the sun is a fantastic metaphor for the climate crisis at large. We are in a state of half realization. I believe that one day the world will wake up from its sleep and see the problem at hand. The only problem is that recognition is barely the first step. The process will take time, but I am still optimistic for the future. One day we will wake up from our deep sleeps and finally  stare into the face of climate change.
<br><hr>
Our issues with consumerism runs deep in our society and our sense of self. It is a difficult concept to let go of as it is routinely ingrained in us from children, and every day we see ads for the next great thing. It is a sad reality that large companies such as Apple just so egregiously releases new models of phones and hardware that are slightly different than the last because they know people don’t think about why they are purchasing it, they just want the next best thing. Ultimately we are failing ourselves when it comes to this. We must be the ones to hold these companies to higher standards and not purchase their products just because they are “new”. We collectively have the power to influence and destroy these massive companies if we all just realized that they only want our money, not what’s best for us. That is what influences them. Not necessarily technological advancement, or putting out the best product possible, but what will make money for them with the least amount of effort. Take a fashion company such as H&M (since Thoreau rightfully has an issue with the Paris fashion industry). They recently started using more “green” materials to make their clothes. Sounds good, except the method in which that clothing is produced is still a net-negative to the environment. But they would never say that, and people most likely wouldn’t think twice about it. Here is a link to the reddit post should anybody wish to see it: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ex7t3m/hm_accused_of_greenwashing_over_plans_to_make/
 <br><br>

Social media is an entirely different beast. I agree with everything you’ve brought up about how the discrepancy between our actual reality and what we want to show to others creates a divide between our sense of who we are, and that is dangerous, not only for the poster’s mental health, but for those who view it as well. It’s spreading misinformation, and those who do it are being dishonest and contributing to the problem with almost every post they have. Most people don’t stop and think about, “is this person really happy?”, or “is this actually how they live and act?”. They just absorb what they see, take it on face-value, and move on to the next post in a matter of seconds, all while what they see is being ingrained in their subconscious and negatively influencing how they view the world and other people. It can also be a horrific eco-chamber for people who just want to find people similar to them and never understand other people’s thoughts or feelings. They just want validation for who they are, and that is good enough. Society has become a competition for who can have the best things, who can make it big, who can be popular, when life shouldn’t be about any of those things. It should be about improving ourselves as individuals, improving/educating others on real facts, and creating a better society as a whole.
 <br><br>

That is why I respect and like Thoreau’s thoughts and actions in “Walden”. He understands that people’s attitudes towards consumerism will never make them happy, they will only be disappointed when the next new thing comes and they can’t get it. Thoreau’s introspection is commendable, and most people don’t do enough of it. He strips away everything that is unimportant, and knows that those things are insignificant compared to who he is deep down as a person, and what he cares about. He shows that anybody is capable of doing this, even today, it’s just that we choose not to or simply don’t think about it. We need to simplify our lifestyles to allow for more consideration of who we are as individuals, and how we can better ourselves. As Ken said, we cannot live the lives we are cultured into; the lavish lifestyles, consumerism, greed, they all need to go before we can truly advance.
<br><hr>
I agree with the points you made. It really stuck with me when Ken mentioned how quickly we discard clothing when it becomes unfashionable. The concept of fast fashion, especially among Americans, sickens me. This reminds me of the film Minimalism and how much our “stuff” affects us even if we are not aware of it. This is how I am objectively judging my own life. I am guilty of contributing to fast fashion, thinking that a piece of clothing will make me happier. The way we view our worth depending on having the best and luxurious items saddens me. The constant competition we as a society are in with ourselves and others to have the most stuff is terrifying. If Thoreau's Walden is still applicable today after 166 years where will we be in another 166 years? How can it get worse than this?
<br><hr>
I agree with everything you said. No one is ever really satisfied with the way they live. Everyone has their idea of their perfect life and all the things that they think will make them happy. People aspire to live like celebrities. I have to say that I am guilty of comparing my life to people on social media. When I catch myself thinking these things it bothers me because while I may be wanting to be like them I think about all the things in my life that I am grateful for and I get mad at myself for wanting to be someone different. Society is definitely full of competition, its everywhere. There has been so many times where I see really cute and trendy clothes and I really want to buy some of the items and then I realize that I just don’t need them because I will probably only wear it a few times and stuff it into the back of my closet. I am becoming better at not being so attached to the things that I own and just being content with the important things and relationships in my life.

The chapter 1 of Thoreau’s Walden, Economy, distinctively portrays Thoreau’s simple lifestyle and his economic attitude associated with the environment. In his idea, people who inherit big lands, houses, and livestocks actually become the serfs of the lands. They are exhausted because of labor and making money, casting a fetter of gold and silver for themselves and turning into machines. Thoreau discusses several necessary things for human, which are food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. These are just used to retain the generated and absorbed heat and he talks about them one by one. Through reading his opinion about clothing, I understand that most of us have already forgotten the true reasons of clothing, which are retaining the vital heat and covering the nakedness. His 19th century idea precisely forecasts and criticizes the consumerism nowadays in the 21th century. Take myself as an example, I pursue fashion and trends of clothing usually, and I always purchase new clothes every season. However, I don’t find myself very satisfied even if I keep purchasing. In contrast, Thoreau paid a little money for clothing, but he actually felt pleasant and contented. He did so because he understand the unnecessary consumerism and instead he focuses the rich of his innermost being. Furthermore, I really appreciate his depiction of the natural scenery, such as huckleberries, cherries, nettle-trees, red pines, white grapes, and yellow violet. When he describes the environment around his shelter, I expose myself to that beautiful natural landscape, where human co-exist with the nature in harmony. However, the only thing that I am confused about is vegetarianism. I learned before from nutrition guide that meat proteins are significant for human’s health such as fish and chicken. I agree with Thoreau to eat simply and austerely, but I am not sure about whether we can get necessary nutrition following the vegetarianism.

I agree with you 100%. In Thoreau’s Walden his simple lifestyle is the most important example he mentions. I like how you mention the examples he uses for the several necessary things for human life which are food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. I think today people have lost track of these essential things necessary for humans which is why global warming has increased over the years. Nowadays everyone wants to be flashy and buy the best cars, clothes, houses etc, but they do not take into account how these impact the planet or not. I like how you use the example of clothes to show how it impacts the planet. I am the same and buy new clothes every season, but after reading Walden I am going to be more mindful about this.

Reading the first chapter of Thoreau's Walden was very interesting as it had me consider the underlying cultural influences that push us individually into wanting more and more luxury things to the detriment of our environment.  It is amazing that a book written at the end of the 19th century can still have so much meaning today.  Back when it was written people had no idea that man made climate change was even possible, and much less so that it would become such an issue.  Yet it still talked about important cultural fascinations with trends and luxury that Americans are still plagued by today.  What interested me the most was how the book differs from what we have been talking about in class in terms of why it is our American lifestyles need to change to solve the climate crisis issue.  For the past three weeks class has been understandably focused on how important it is to change our overly consuming ways for the sake of our future selves and our planet.  After all the biggest benefit to Americans scaling down their lives would be well, the world not ending.  However Walden made me think of the other side to why it could be a good idea for our culture to put less emphasis on consumerism and luxury.  It focused on a more personal scale, the most personal in fact, with it being the subjective experience of one singular man who decided to go against the norms of his culture and live the simplest life he could.  In denying himself these unnecessary yet culturally desired luxuries he came to realize just how little is needed for man to survive, and do so happily, in our world.  It made me think how changing our ways of life to be environmentally conscious,  while at first sounding like a necessary sacrifice we needed prevent horrible things, could actually bring about more personal appreciation of and enjoyment in our lives.  Our culture is so focused on scaling up our lifestyles, always working so we can afford more and better things, but it may be that scaling down our lifestyles and appreciating simpler things like nature and our freedom is what can lead us to live happier and environmentally healthy lives.

The idea that scaling down our lifestyles to be simpler and more environmentally conscious could make us more appreciative and happier is a very interesting thought. I do believe that truly appreciating everything we have in our lives would bring us lots of fulfillment. However, I believe the transition for many individuals into a more simplistic lifestyle is going to be very hard. As of today, the material items people possess including our clothing, cars, furniture, and other accessories often reflect a lot about their status and class. As a society we use materialistic things to try to appear wealthier or better than others, and therefore we are always striving to get something more luxurious and expensive. Many famous and successful individuals often spend large amounts of money on unnecessarily large homes and expensive cars. These types of lifestyles are often seen as “ideal” to the average citizen which places an even higher value and importance on these luxury goods. Scaling down our lifestyles is going to need to become a new trend in America. Many people are going to need to embark on this journey in order for others to follow suit, especially people whose lives we idolize.

When I saw that Ken assigned us to read Henry David Thoreou’s work, I questioned why in the hell is Ken making us read this work of literature? How can this possibly relate to our class? But I was already making such assumptions without having read the text yet. As I started to read I was pretty intrigued with what Thoreou had to say and the simplistic life he believed in. It amazed me how this work was written so long ago and for Thoreau to have already caught on to such ideas is insane. I could only imagine how cruel his critiques would be in todays time. Walden was written in 1854, the 19th century, an era that doesn't even compare to what our economy has come to now; capitalistic, materialistic, maximalist, and straight up money hungry in order to live the American dream of a lavish lifestyle. I can now see why Ken assigned this reading and how it is very relevant to our class. In last week's lecture videos, Ken mentions five important actions that Americans can do to dramatically reduce our climate footprints - we must take into consideration our use of transportation, housing, food production, population, and the amount we consume because those are where our main carbon footprints come from. Everything that Thoreau mentions relates to the five necessary actions that we must take. For example, Thoreau builds himself a small home with his own hands away from everybody and uses the bare minimum to survive. He grows his own food, consuming a vegan diet, he has minimal pieces of clothing, and a small number of appliances/furniture, arguing that is all you need to survive - as long as you have shelter, food, clothing, and fuel you should be satisfied because what more does one need?

I strongly agree that Walden was way ahead of his time, especially with such a massive courage to challenge society's norms and his everyday routine. We’re unconsciously held captive by capitalism and companies that feed our never ending desires to have more and more. If Thoreau was around today he would be extremely upset and concern about our lifestyle. Fast fashion, new iPhones, extravagant foods, bigger houses and cars, we’re all surrounded by items that we think fulfills our satisfaction but the truth is we just don’t know how to appreciate the little things in life. I understand that people work hard to have nice things in life as a reward, however how many of those nice things are necessities? I’ve noticed that people purchase big homes for only 1 to 3 people max to live in them. If it’s a big family it is understandable to get a big house, but other than that, all the space that big houses take up for just a few people could work for building minimalist houses where more people can live in. Thoreau’s challenge is definitely something we should all, as a society, take part in. Not only would we be helping in limiting how much resources we consume, but we would also be helping our health and wallet. This could help us reconsider what really matters in life and what really deserves our attention.

I thought the exact same thing, infact I audibly sighed when I saw Walden was assigned because I'd read parts of it before and was confused about the assignment. I knew it would relate, but honestly I just really don't care for Thoreau's writing. I can however agree with you and appreciate the fact that he was far ahead of his time. To think he was concerned with was consumerism before it was really even a thing. He would probably have an aneurism if he saw the current state we are in. Despite his wordy pretentious tone his claims are valid, and ideally if the concept of the American dream has shifted to Thoreau's idealized vision perhaps we wouldn't facing this climate catastrophe. This dramatic lifestyle change is whats needed to halt the detrimental effects of our actions, and it needs to happen quickly. Now I'm not saying everyone should stop what they are doing and go build a shack, but keeping in mind moderation is really the key. Many people aspire for the American dream, and honestly it is just an unsustainable and largely unachievable ideal- so we should aim to transform this historical archetype life. If we did this, it would help developing countries and new generations to not make the same mistake we did- and until we do this America cannot really critique other countries efforts. The U.S. sets the pace, so perhaps we should take into account the lifestyle depicted in Walden
 <br><br>

I challenge myself and others to reject materialism and consumerism and the cycle it has enveloped us in. All one needs to find happiness is perspective, and I think Thoreau understood this.
<br><hr>
I completely agree. When I first saw the assigned reading I thought it would be a more philosophical reading with a different message than the one I was represented with after the reading. I understood why this reading was necessary for this class as it shows you how simple living could be done. I think that this way of living life is a lot better than most as we would all be satisfied. It is the notion that we need bigger and more quantities of stuff that has drove us to the environment and earth being in danger. Although it was simpler times back when this was written as objects were cheaper and a lot had not been created I think this is something that we can still learn from and implement into our daily lives. In anthropology we learned about different types of subsistence systems and how foragers/horticulture are able to rely on their own crops to sustain their life. I think if we were more able to live off of what we arew without exceeding production then we would not only be living a healthier life, but also one that damaged the earth far less. It is our agriculture and world system that has led to us living lives of large quantities of meat and places where there are more chickens and cows than people actually living there.

<br><hr>
Walden can only make me think of a famous Chinese figure Yuanming Tao. He and Thoreau are both live ‘outside’ the world. However, they had different reasons. Yuanming Tao did this, not because he wants to protect the environment and live a healthier lifestyle. He did this because he hated the controller at that time. However, the similar thing is, they all enjoyed their lifestyle. In ancient China, the era when Yuanming Tao lived, I don’t think there was the notion of protecting the environment. So he is not relevant to the topic. However, since these two people are similar in some ways, I think it’s interesting to mention him and contrast them. Yuanming Tao might consider politic pollution a pollution. I suggest more people know about who Yuanming Tao is if they are interested.

<br><hr>
When first reading Walden, I was also struck by the extremity of his approach in attempting to do away with all consumerism and dependence on others. Understandably, I could see why an idealist like Thoreau would reject the status quo because he saw sooner than most people the fact that the lifestyles we live are not sustainable nor fulfilling. In terms of what humans need, Thoreau points out that, “the improvements of ages have had but little influence on the essential laws of man's existence”. This point encompasses the entire sentiment of minimalism - what we want is not necessarily what we need. Thoreau goes on to assert that, “most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.” When reading Walden and watching the documentary on Minimalism, this point ties in to the ongoing trend of mass consumerism as a wasteful practice more than a purposeful movement. 
 <br><br>
If Thoreau held society in contempt for its consumerism, especially in terms of the fashion industry in his time, I cannot fathom how appalled he would be by the fast fashion and throwaway culture of today’s fashion industry. He would realize that his book fell upon deaf ears. In truth, what Thoreau attempted in his experiment at Walden pond would be next to impossible for many people to achieve in today’s society. Our economy and our existence is heavily dependent on the production of goods and services by other people. Some people are not even capable of cleaning their own houses or doing their own laundry.

<br><hr>

I respect Thoreau because he was almost the earliest human being that had a sense and felt the responsibility to protect the environment. Normally, it needs reasons to make people do something. However, in the ‘ancient’ time when information traveled slowly, why did Thoreau know and protect the environment and live a healthy lifestyle? How did he know? These questions just come up to me and I think they are interesting.
<br><hr>
Thank you for mentioning Tao Yuanming and his motive for wanting to live outside the norm, I really appreciated it. I took your advice and went out of my way to do some research on him just to see what his motives were for wanting to live in “reclusion,” as it stated during my online search. His lifestyle was indeed pretty simple; living in a small house in the countryside with occasional guest, writing poetry. I also learned that he didn't eat any meat, he desired natural behaviors, wanted to live according to nature, and overall just accepted a simple life. Pretty interesting to see that Thoreou and Yuanming both lived these lifestyles but for different reasons. In today's time, I believe we should maintain the simple lifestyle but for the obvious reason that it will help our environmental crisis. I'm not saying we should go out of our way and build ourselves a small house in the middle of nowhere, but we should be more aware of the food we consume, the unnecessary stuff we buy, and overall just being conscious of the harm we are causing.
<br><hr>
This idea is actually ‘minimalism,’ illustrated in this weeks’ documentary. In modern world, this is a lifestyle that I actually think it’s pretty cool. In ancient time, it was a pretty simple way of life. I think it’s cool because people can minimize their stuff and maximize the space, so that they can allow more happiness and friends in. I think it’s this way in ancient time as well. I understand it is hard to connect the idea of minimalism to climate crisis, but climate crisis is actually human crisis because climate crisis will only harm humans and animals instead of climate itself. Thus, we need to protect ourselves. One way to do that is probably living a simpler lifestyle so that we don’t waste so many stuff.

I completely agree. It wasn't until I started reading Thoreau's "Walden,' that I realized the main point: that people live in excess and it is completely unnecessary. Thoreau argues to simplify life. Reading this piece further proved the point to me that people can live minimalistically, because we don’t need all of the extra things we own to live a full or meaningful life. Our lives should not be ranked on the objects we own. Ken's generation did not change or adapt to what Thoreau says, and now the world is experiencing grave consequences. As Ken says, we cannot "live the lives scripted" for us. We have to change the course given to us by Ken's generation, and live minimalistically. I am sure Thoreau would be deeply disappointed if he saw the consumerism driven lives we live today. 
 <br><br>

I believe Thoreau's challenge should have been taken more serious, much longer ago. Now, it is imperative we act. Thoreau is a perfect example of someone trying to change their lifestyle through different housing, food, and clothes. I believe that we should all try and simplify. Changing simple aspects of our lifestyles will greatly reduce our carbon footprint, as we have heard in past lectures from Ken. In seeing that there have been guidelines for simple lives for so long, it disappoints me that people consciously choose to live in excess. Thoreau states, “The evil that men do lives after them.” I believe that this quote pertains perfectly to one of the messages of the class. The damage done to the planet by Ken's generation and before will have delayed consequences that my generation will face. Overall, we should try our hardest to live simply, like Thoreau explains. Our lifestyles have gotten out of control, and revolve around materialistic things that we do not need.

The author Thoreau lived in the year of 1800s. It’s amazing to see that he already knew to protect the environment. Compare to people nowadays who should know that there are environmental issues, or even compare to people in his era that didn’t know there are environmental issues (I assume he didn’t know there were environmental issues, or there were not environmental issues), he was a role model for people who wants to protect the environment.
 <br><br>
I suggest we don’t blame Ken’s generation from now on. “Blaming” doesn’t create positive effect. We want to start to do real things, or take Ken’s generation to start to do real things, such as being minimalism, consume less meat, and plant more trees to protect the environment. “Blaming” is a verbal stuff, while achieving goals need “action.”

Henry David Thoreau lived in the woods for years in a repurposed railroad supply box which he bought for one dollar in the 1850s. His concerns of food, housing and shelter are topics that have only become more relevant over time. While in the woods, Thoreau compares the ideal housing in this country to follow the Native American wigwams. He states that as we continue to develop larger cities, only a “savage” would seek to purchase permanent residence within the city limits. Living simply is probably the theme which he is trying to get across to the reader. While I can understand where Thoreau is coming from, the world we live in has changed far past the expectations set in Walden. Culturally now more than ever, property is sought after, and unlike in his time, we can’t just buy a living space for cheap and live in the woods. There are people who do that, and they are horribly misunderstood and mistreated, I am referring to the homeless population. In our current society it has become increasingly common to see homeless people. If you are anything like me, you probably feel bad for them in their current situations. To our generation, living without a stereotypical home is deemed unusual and more than likely we will disregard these human beings. I was raised not to stare at them, not to interact with them, and not to assist them monetarily. “you’ll just be supporting their drug habit” this phrase has been uttered by countless parents and it teaches us early on that people without traditional housing are in one group, they use drugs, they are pan handlers etc.… but when you take a step back, what’s almost more disgusting is the lack of help offered to these often mentally ill individuals who much of the time have done nothing wrong. I’m trying not to generalize, because homeless people are just that, people. People are unpredictable, if we put them in a box and relegate their existence to a few instances, we neglect a portion of our society who is often overlooked and underrepresented. So, although in Thoreau’s day, it wasn’t frowned upon in his society to distance yourself from society and live in the woods, in our current society, those living out a lifestyle that Thoreau describes in Walden are routinely disregarded and seen as pests.

I too agree that our society compared to the society Thoreau experienced is extremely developed and ideas expressed deem impossible for our society due to stigmas. Living in a smaller property, riding a bike/walking to your destination, decreasing meat intake, and recycling clothing all have a stigma towards them...one of poverty. In America people idolize luxurious lifestyles: new designer clothes, cars, and mansions are all sought after as the ideal lifestyle when that is the opposite of what is needed in the world. We would need to switch the mindsets of a large amount of people, especially Americans who crave luxury the most and that would be hard to do. Trying to convince the vast majority that living in a property the size of a shed is better than living in a luxurious mansion would never be possible as most people would laugh at the idea especially if they had money. 
 <br><br>

People need to understand that becoming one with nature and developing that relationship would benefit the earth and their environment even if it means sacrificing the life they always wanted. Luxury can be part of 1 generation a generation lucky enough to enjoy this world so glamorously until their glamorous ruined it for the generations to come. Our generation again is forced to succumb to the consequences of the actions of our grandparents/parents generation by having to reduce our desires and return to the natural state of living with nature. Giving up meat would be hard, but as a way to reduce CO2 emission methane needs to be reduced and fish are decreasing in the ocean due to the loss of coral reef so reducing meat intake would overall benefit the earth. While it would be hard for myself to live the way Thoreau wants us to I believe that if I truly needed to live that way I would be able to with ease, but I sadly cannot say that most people would be able to give up their lifestyles with ease.

Henry David Thoreau's Walden conveys the concept of minimalism and living simply. When I read this book in high school, I was intrigued by the courage Walden had to seek a life full of simplicity and self-reliance. Set in the 1800s, Walden set forth in living in a place that would isolate him from his ordinary life.  This dramatic change in Thoreau's lifestyle allowed him to engage with his mind and find his true self.

 <br><br>

In today's consumer society, living life simply is considered unorthodox. Material possessions guide human beings into making decisions that impact everyday lives. Learning about minimalism has given me a different outlook on life. Living a hectic life to fulfill the void we feel is not the answer. Instead, we must appreciate the little things that occur in our day to day life. Living in a simple state of mind can allow us to have less stress, fewer distractions and connect with our loved ones. I am also not saying that one should give up all their wealth/material possesions that has been obtained through hard work and dedication, but it is also not a justifiable way to evaluate a person's happiness or success. Walden was a man ahead of his time, who envisioned a consumerist society that would take over people's true happiness.

I agree with your statement, I had not considered the courage that it would have taken Thoreau to begin a new life isolated from social norm. Personally, I do not think I could find that kind of resolve in my current lifestyle to pack up what I know, and completely change. I cannot imagine someone from the 21st century doing what Thoreau did, I imagine it would be difficult. However, my perception may just be limited by my own strong attachment to modern technologies and ease of access to virtually anything. 
 <br><br>


I agree with your insight as to how minimalism can improve one’s life overall- emotionally, financially, and environmentally. It seems that consumer culture has always been a perceivable threat, but in recent years the societal repercussions have skyrocketed. Although not everyone has the resolve to change their lives the same way that Thoreau does, every reader can walk away realizing there are simple ways to improve their life outlook.
<br><hr>
I agree that Thoreau conveys a concept of minimalism and living simply. Thoreau's "Walden" is just as controversial as it was then as it is today. Back in Thoreau's time, he was met with fierce opposition calling his changed lifestyle "unmanly", "very wicked and heathenish" and called Thoreau an "unsocial being, a troglodyte of sorts". Even before consumer culture arrived Americans saw Thoreau's view as radical and were threatened by it. Today Americans are surrounded by consumer culture and I agree with you about how Americans live a hectic life to fill a void. This culture is dangerous and unhealthy yet people are addicted to this way of life. I am honestly disgusted with people's over consumption and how if everybody lived like an American we would need 5.4 Earth's to sustain our demand. 
 <br><br>


I want to practice a life that goes against this. A life that is another option to the average selfish American capitalist. I don't want to be a part of the system that destroys the planet, but a part of one that helps defend it. Thoreau's message in "Walden" resonates with me for that reason. He pities the farmer because he was born into a system that makes them "serfs to the soil". I was not born a farmer, but I was born into the California suburb society that values materialistic things. I want out and I think the way to do so is follow Thoreau's way of thought and apply it to today to meet my needs and wants.

Hi thank you for sharing and I completely agree with your comment! I also think that our modern society has become way too materialistic and money-centered in general that morality is lost along with the true meaning of life which the majority of the society had failed to realize. There are so many distractions and unnecessary "necessities" in our lives that we tend to get distracted so easily and lose focus on our lives. Going back to Ken's lecture videos from last week on the five environmentally-friendly suggestions that we can all partake in order to save our environment, and Thoreau is achieving several of them already in Walden such as his vegetarian diet and the simple clothes that he wears. If we are to really think about and connect those five tips with Thoreau's Walden, we will see that they have many similarities that those five suggestions are indeed ways to make our lives more simple through constructing a minimalistic lifestyle. Take housing as an example: do we really need a three-story mansion house with an enormous backyard, golf court, basement, and swimming pool for, say, a family of four? Isn't it way too big and spacious for such a small housing population? If such a house needs to be built then there should be at least ten people residing inside to make it actually worth all the money and efforts of building it. You might scoff at this question and say, "That's ridiculous,", but there are countless families particularly wealthy celebrities and upper-class people owning and living in mansions that have huge carbon footprints today, and they barely get criticized if at all. This shows how the need to show off one's socio-economic status and pride in one's financial achievement is so deeply ingrained in our society that it is becoming a norm or even worse, common sense. If someone who, after so many years of hard work and could well afford a mansion for his/her family, does not own such a house but live in a much smaller one or even an apartment, then this person ought to feel ashamed for doing this because they are "stupid to not enjoy the results of their hard work and financial achievement" even though their actions are benefiting our environment by leaving a smaller carbon footprint.

Honestly speaking, I attempted to start reading Walden several times before, but failed. Everytime I just kickoff from the first few pages and think the words are abstract and I just cannot find relatability to them. And admittedly, the sentences in first person made me feel a little uncomfortable. They’re kind of condescending and complacent. However, as the reading becomes compulsory this time and with the help of Ken’s video introduction, I gradually changed my view through the course of reading. Among the first few people who proposed a minimalistic style of living, and who actually practiced the experiment, Thoreau is avant-garde in his era, especially when I got to know that he was relatively wealthy, which means no economic incentive. I am always picturing the life if I suddenly got so much money. The answer and hope, for now, will definitely not to keep my money and be minimalism. So for this point, I paid high respect to Thoreau. 
 <br><br>


And for the misunderstanding of his egotism, I altered my mind when I saw his opinion about self-reliance and being a better person. That is, with the four basic necessities--food, shelter, clothing, and fuel--people can “combine the toughness of primitive life with the intellectualness of civilization”. Furthermore, his self-reliance and well-being is not meant to be emulated by those who have already led a fulfilled lives or found their unique ways. He is just offering advice to a lot of people trapped by money and work, or the rich who highly valued the luxurious lifestyle, upgrading themselves and degrading the poor. Therefore, we should not judge others  by their architecture or material wealth, but the richness of their abstract thought. 
 <br><br>


Among all, I agree with most parts of Thoreau’s Walden experiment, but still reserve some opinions regarding his skeptics to College students and philanthropy. Indeed, some of them are just like what he said, wasting money and time on no use, but you cannot be radical by affirming that no one of them voluntarily choose to do things either for education or helping others.

I agree with you. I honestly had a difficult time reading this first chapter of Walden. It was very long, and it was written in a way that I'm completely not used to. If it weren't for this video introduction, I probably would not have followed along with Thoreau's writing. Despite what I thought about his writing style, I greatly commend Thoreau. In a time where everybody strives for the American Dream, he put forth an idea that went against this dream. It’s always tough being an outlier in society; however, Thoreau’s message was one that needed to be spread. People must shake-off society’s materialistic expectations because they are environmentally disastrous. His idea of simplicity and self-reliance is even more important today as the climate crisis is becoming more and more serious of an issue. In America, this goal is very tough to accomplish, but we need to try our best to minimize the things that we own.


<br><hr>
I completely agree with you. I felt the difficulties in reading Walden in the first few times that I tried to read them and but I forced myself to go through it this time. Thoreau inspired me to live a simpler life, although I don't think I can ever live as simple as he does, he has definitely put a image of a simpler life in my mind and I'll try my best to approach that way of life. 
 <br><br>
Another thing that got my attention was that his life of simplicity was strictly voluntary. Usually I would assume everyone want to live as wealthy as they can because having things gives us a sense of security. But to live as simple as he did with no outside factors and just out of his heart, that is really mind-blowing and humbling to me. He made me realize that life itself should be savored with nothing and everything.

Thoreau deserves his title of “the father of minimalism” and his place at the table of environmentalism. He does not deserve to have praise heaped upon him, though. What “Walden” strikes me as is the original romanticism of poverty. Thoreau was a college educated man who decided that life in his class was too comfortable, too morally draining, and too expensive, so he decided to live on borrowed land (Ralph Waldo Emerson’s, to be exact, the man he met when he studied at Harvard) and denigrate everyone else for being morally inferior and still living a more “lavish” life, though Thoreau tends to criticize the working-class more than anyone else. I find this behavior to be echoed in modern minimalism; minimalists say that getting rid of one’s physical things and simplifying day to day life is the key to happiness. Anyone who doesn’t want to live like that is automatically considered by proponents to be short-sighted, ignorant of the benefits, or simply brainwashed by a wider consumer culture. I also find Thoreau’s misanthropy to be grating; hating and unrelentingly criticizing your fellow people should not be considered high-brow,  admirable, or somehow profound and revolutionary. 
 <br><br>

This isn’t to say that “Walden” is not a valuable read. Over the years, I’ve had to read most, if not all, of the book. Once I moved past the moralizing, the condescension, and the knowledge that Thoreau lived about two miles away from Concord (hardly “rugged” wild living) I came to appreciate the beauty of his life at Walden Pond. I can’t claim to know anyone who hasn’t thought about dropping it all and running away to live in the wild--a sentiment introduced to American society by Thoreau. His criticisms of the fashion industry, housing industry, and meat-heavy diets of Americans are salient and pertinent to modern life. It seems now that our wants are always increasing: we want more, more, more right now. As Thoreau asked in “Walden,” “Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not sometimes be content with less?” His writings offer an alternative life, but one that I think is too radical to be applied to everyone. I certainly have no desire to live in the woods in a tiny house with no one else around. I would, however, like to live in a community with other like-minded people, who are willing to equally share the fruits of their labor (and mine with them) so that we could all work less than if we were on our own. I appreciate Thoreau’s argument in favor of a plant-based or “reducetarian” diet; as a vegan myself, I agree with him when he states that eating less meat and animal products like butter is not difficult, and it actually makes day to day life so much easier and cheaper. Living in a modest house with modest furnishings is also seductive: less to clean, less to heat, less to maintain. Rejecting the ideas of “success” in our society is something I gleefully accept; I don’t want a fancy house, pretty gas-guzzling car, huge family, or giant wardrobe full of clothes. But expecting people to just give up all of the modern trappings of consumerism is unrealistic; some of us happen to like a little fun and frivolity in our possessions, and I think that making some large simplifying choices leaves room for a small bit of avarice, especially when coupled with activism at a wider scale. In short, simple living is a great place to start and a terrible place to stop when trying to defend the integrity of the planet.

You have put my thoughts into words. I appreciate your criticism of Thoreau's minimalism, and I agree that it does come across as almost braggadocios for what is still only possible for those who are privileged. While he is choosing a "simpler life", it seems as though it is for the sake of being correct, morally and economically, rather than living simply. When comparing his actions in "Walden" to today's world, I highly doubt something similar would be possible to replicate due to the innovation of today and economic hold our world has on all of its entities. However, I agree that the ideology he brings to light regarding the fashion, meat, and housing industry are valid, important, and timelessly relevant. We discuss what boomers knew about their consumption, but look at Thoreau's awareness back in 1854. His condemnation of the consumer lifestyle and capitalistic tendencies, along with his delineation of how to live "without it all" brings up a couple ideas in my mind. First, it makes me consider Buddhist ideals and the goal to dissipate desires. Thoreau mirrors the brahmins in his efforts to escape his own modern commodities and exist as his own being. It reminds me as well of Native American lifestyles and living from and with respect for the land. The sustainable changes Thoreau made in order to exist without excessive resources requires innovative thinking and a connection with nature one cannot have in an economically focused world. 
 <br><br>

Unfortunately, "Walden" also aggressively shoves the catch-22 of the entire sustainability problem directly in its reader's faces. We, as a society, spend our entire lives working for the success that has been demonstrated before us. As Ken says, we are born into roles and do our best to fulfill them. The system has its course and that is why those who have political power are able to control our country as they do. And we, as students, are required to pay for college so that we can have a job to make more money to go to graduate school to maybe one day gain that political power to actually enact change. Yet the solution, the change that is needed, is the eradication of the economic system as we know it. As Thoreau said, "working for pay is enslavement," but it is necessary in order to make any political difference in this world. Though one may become a powerful politician while still denying the fashion industry, eating a vegan diet, sharing a small home, and owning only a bicycle for transportation, there is no possibility of truly embracing "the simple life" that promises full sustainability due to the modern functioning of our society.

<br><hr>
I very much agree with your point that Thoreau is guilty of romanticizing poverty. When he purchases his very small house from the Irish family, he describes how the next morning he saw them on the road with all their belongings on their backs. While he chooses to leave his rather wealthy life, as he came from a fairly well-off family, there were so many impoverished families who had no choice but to live an extremely minimalist lifestyle, as they couldn't afford much else. While Thoreau is living by himself in this shack by Walden pond, an entire family used to live there and to them it was life as usual, while for Thoreau this way of life is more like an experiment he's trying out for a few years (as he only lives there for two years and two months) before he reintegrates into society and life as usual for him.

When I began reading this, I wondered why Hiltner had assigned us such a seemingly trivial piece of literature and how that connected to this class. It seemed like I was about to read an opinion piece on why Thoreau believes a simplistic lifestyle is the most virtuous. It ended up being more of a manual for how to live a simplistic lifestyle mingled together with his argument of what basic human nature really needs. I soon realized that the purpose of reading this was to get the reader to evaluate all of the unnecessary luxuries that we have in our lives and to convince us of why we don’t really need all those extra things. 
 <br><br>


Thoreau repeatedly argues that man has put himself in his own state of misery. All of the advantages we’ve made and the amenities we’ve created have only left us anxious to have it all. We’ve mistakenly put ourselves in a vicious cycle of never feeling fully fulfilled with what we have. This has left us miserable, and from his economic point of view, poor. I don’t think that the point he makes is wrong. It’s a fair analysis that the very goods we have provided ourselves with, are the culprits that are stealing our happiness. Thoreau provides us with the example of one finding a nicely fitted suit, and then from that point on always expecting that their clothes will fit as perfectly as that suit did. I think, at the minimum, this expresses the human tendency that we allow our definition of normal or average to develop as the things around us develop. It’s how we adapt and survive in society.
  <br><br>

So then how does all this fit into the environmental theme of this class? Consumerism. And not simple consumerism, but consumerism without thinking of the consequences it could be having. Going back to the example of the suit, once one becomes acclimated to the fruits of life, they begin to accept nothing less than that, no matter what it takes in order to continue developing that quality of goods. The clothing industry is notoriously wasteful as well as ethically poor. Despite this, people continue to spend their weekends on shopping sprees and use any excuse to go buy new and better things. This is the epitome of ignorant consumerism. We not only buy and spend, but we treat those activities as luxuries that we’re fortunate to take part in. This attitude is why it’s so incredibly difficult to change habits. In our current age, people are unwilling to give up the convenience of dirty fossil fuels in replace of more expensive renewable sources of energy, like solar panels. Sadly, this is leading us on a path to environmental disaster, if we haven’t reached that point yet. Our own stubbornness of not wanting to give up our luxuries is going to bring about a whole new state of misery for the human species as we know it. We must challenge the role that we were born into in order to bring about much-needed changes.

I was also confused at first why Ken had assigned this reading to us. I think you’re right- it was meant to open our eyes to the unnecessarily lavish way that Americans and people around the globe live today, although it is clearly possible to obtain a much simpler lifestyle. I understand this point and its significance, as well as the way consumerism ties back to both the reading and this class, but I felt like this reading was excessive and inessential for the message it was trying to portray. For literary and analysis purposes, Thoreau’s recounting of his decision and the specific costs and more are probably relevant, but I didn’t think the majority of Walden was helpful to this class. Its importance mainly comes back to what Ken mentioned in the lecture: simplicity. This could’ve been summarized in a 1-minute video.
   <br><br>
Still, there are obviously major differences from when Thoreau ventured into the wilderness and the world today. It is considerably more difficult to drop everything in your life, move out into the middle of nowhere, and build your own house. Although it is unlikely anyone will take as drastic measures as Thoreau, there are small steps that we can all easily do to simplify our lives and benefit the environment. Begin the shift towards a plant-based diet, slowly reducing meat consumption. Shop at thrift stores instead of big brand-name companies. Carpool. If people start looking at climate change in this perspective, where they are willing to make small changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there might actually be positive effects on the planet.


<br><hr>

I appreciated your comments on our lack of fulfillment. Our need to be in some sort of excessive state of achievement, not necessarily for our own benefit, but rather societies’ seemingly endless perceived needs. In my opinion, Walden begins by attempting to disprove perceptions concerning modern living. Specifically, I found that the focus on the affordability of living and act of working towards intentional actions was particularly important. More so than minimalism, Thoreau came across as unabashedly intentional in his actions, arguments, and outlook for life. This intentionality defines Walden for me, as his focus on developing a life where his results are meaningful seem like a strong precursor to the current notion of Minimalism.

<br><hr>
I agree with your points. The cultural trend now influenced people to a better-off life which is shaped by consumerism and materialism. People keep chasing fancy commodities: the latest phones, clothes, cars, and money as well. Because of the contribution of Internet development, people see each other online and their lives. Just like what you comment, human has the habit of comparing to each other and this is a reason why we are not satisfied with our life and we will never be happy. There are always people that own commodities that you don’t have.  The cultural trend now has been like comparison and buying always. Actually, chasing all these staff cannot lead to happiness which people called “American Dream” or “Great Goals in life ever”. Just like Minimalists said in the film “Minimalism”, “Money doesn’t buy happiness” and I believe real Happiness comes from the heart and simple things.  Also, if the society is overwhelmed by money, the newest commodities, fashion or something else that included in consumerism, the climate on Earth will be worse off. Getting rid of fancy, unnecessary material things is a challenge to most people in the world in fact. Just as Thoreau criticized in his first chapter on his neighbors who inclined to have material thing, Thoreau who have the idea of simple life write the literature almost 150 years ago. He lives in a simple life and believes in a simple lifestyle which is what nowadays people should chase.

Having read Walden before, I truly admire Thoreau’s efforts to reduce the “stuff” in his life and find joy in the simplicity of the essentials. I am a huge fan of the minimalist movement and think it has the ability to change a person’s life. It obviously did for Thoreau. In my journey of switching to a more sustainable lifestyle, I have been fascinated with the concepts of tiny houses and capsule wardrobes, both being championed by Thoreau. 
  <br><br>


I think college students are in a unique situation to become proponents of a minimal, simplistic lifestyle. We typically do not have our own room due to housing prices and are often not in the same space for more than a couple years. I think minimalism can largely benefit college students in reducing their stress by decreasing the amount of money and time we spend on our items. Instead of spending an hour every day putting away our junk, we can spend 10 and gain an extra 50 mins doing homework, sleeping, spending time with friends, or just rest from the hectic lives we live. Minimalism also helps us to save money since we are not making impulse decisions, allowing us to save money. To those that are genuinely interested in this way of living, I highly recommend listening to The Minimalists podcast for inspiration!

I think the cyclical nature of the minimalist movement and others like it is interesting. Way back in the 1850s, Thoreau was advocating for vegetarianism, small living spaces, and minimal clothing. Today, similar movements are taking shape as many people are switching to plant-based or vegetarian diets and thrifting is exploding in response to the wastefulness of the textile industry. I think more people need to be happy with what they have and see their lives in the context of the globe as a whole. Most people in America have it so good compared to the rest of the world, we should be content with what we have and not spend our money on unnecessary crap we don't need. As to your point about college students, I agree. As the next generation of people that will be buying houses and spending our disposable income, we can play a role, however small, in changing some of the habits in this country. As bad as it sounds, I think pressuring people or getting on them for living excessive lifestyles may be an effective option. If we can create societal pressure to live minimalist, eat vegetarian, shop less, etc. then we may be able to make minimalism "cool" and gradually see some change. I personally take pride in wearing my clothes for as long as possible and not spending my money on non-essentials.


<br><hr>
I truly agree with this minimalist approach to life and how the benefits will definitely outweigh the drawbacks. We spend so much money because of the consumer culture we are stuck in, but can easily fix this by reducing our spending to only the things we truly need. I feel like especially since I got to UCSB, I have realized how important living a more simple lifestyle really is. Rather than stress about what we don't have, we need to be happy with what we have and all of the good things in our lives. I know that it is very hard to not buy clothes from your favorite shop or spend money on eating outside, but if we gradually lower our spending it won't be that difficult. A big part of this that I noticed Thoreau talked about and was mentioned in Ken's video was vegetarianism and how important taking up this lifestyle is. Although I am not vegetarian, I can see how big of an impact this can have on our earth, and I have lowered the amount of meat I eat (and try to stick to chicken for the most part).

This simple lifestyle Thoreau advocates for might be difficult to transition into for some people, but it has so many benefits for oneself (both physically and spiritually) which is why I believe that we should all try to change our habits in some ways to help the environment and ourselves. Thoreau's challenge to rewrite our roles is directly associated with this simple lifestyle idea and if we take this idea into our own lives, we can make a significant impact on the earth. The amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere now due to the meat industry and digging up fossil fuels is truly devastating and needs to be reduced greatly. If we stop being so selfish and understand the consequences associated with climate change we can truly make a difference.

Having also read Walden before, I was able to reread the chapter a little differently than before. What was really emphasized this time around when I read the first chapter was the personal benefits Thoreau gained from simplifying his life rather than how minimalism can help the environment. I think if people saw the personally benefits of reducing their amount of "stuff" they would see that they end up living happier more fulfilling lives in what Thoreau describes as a somewhat clearer view of seeing the world and being one with it. 
  <br><br>


I agree with you that as college students we are someone forced into this lifestyle of condensing our material possessions into what we actually need. This is especially applicable for people with roommates as you have to cut down your inventory to half or even one third of what you would usually posses within your room. I have also stated that because we are in college, it allows us to spread ideas such as minimalism to places way further than Santa Barbara. For example if when college students went home they explained the effects on minimalism and showed others how to live simpler life back home this effect could be compounded throughout the United States.


<br><hr>
I have never read Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden” before, so I had no idea what to expect when starting this week’s assignment. Once I finished I was amazed by what he had done to show how pleasant and easy life can be if you keep your wants/needs simple. It is incredibly difficult for people today to do what he did because our society has changed drastically since 1854. Although many have successfully changed their lifestyles to be minimalists, it is not something that can be done in one day. I agree with you Madison, Thoreau’s building his own cabin, raising his own food, and living life in the simplicity way possible was life-changing for him, as well as many others who partake in the minimalism lifestyle. 
   <br><br>

I also love the point you made about college students being able to benefit from a more minimal/simplistic lifestyle. Although I can understand why many do not think of it as an option not having the ability to make these changed in our lives because we do not get the choice. We are forced to live in dorms in our first years, and many people continue to live in university housing after that. Those who don’t normally live in buildings where they cannot make any environmentally conscious decisions. On top of this no one is going to be living near campus for long, just a few years therefore many do not see a point in changing their lifestyle drastically because in a year or two they won’t be in this area anymore. Minimalism has proven to be amazing for your own mental health as well as the environment, and if humans were not so sentimental I am sure more people would partake in the minimalistic lifestyle.
<br><hr>

I think that your point about college students being in an ideal position to act on and embrace this minimalistic lifestyle is a really valid point that I never really thought of in that way. I think the problem with this however is that most college students live this life with the intentions of going bigger and better in the future after having experienced such living conditions. I think that for most people, college living isn't super ideal and I think that has a lot to do with how society is so industrialized and modern. The minimalist lifestyle is typically only attractive to a particular subset of what i can see as "artsier" people of the world who can find the magic in living a life like that. Most people due to the way the world works nowadays like things extravagant and large because that’s what we see in the media as the goal. Big, rich and fancy homes and belongings is what has always been the picture perfect life. Look at barbie toys for instance; their doll houses are most definitely not simplistic, painting a high expectation for children at such a young age.
   <br><br>

A point that Thoreau makes that helps change this viewpoint though is where he writes, "It is not necessary that a man should earn his living by the sweat of his brow, unless he sweats easier than I do," which almost validates that you don't have to work your ass off to become rich in order to achieve this glorious lifestyle; you can do a lot less and still live a perfect life. I think that this is something that we will need to condition ourselves to because it definitely is not something that a majority of the world is used to. I also think it should be targeted at the correct subset of the population because telling this to people who do not have the means to live this large lifestyle to begin with already understand the idea of living minimally.
<br><hr>

I definitely agree that the minimalist movement has the potential to change human lives for the better. However, I must say, that even though Henry David Thoreau's experience was interesting, it was also extreme and impractical, especially for the people of modern society. There are few people out there who would be okay with living in a small home with just the most basic of necessities. For Thoreau, it made sense because all he wanted to do for the rest of his life was read and write, but in modern society people feel like they have bigger purposes and would not survive knowing that they could achieve more. It is a tendency for humans to constantly be working for a more advanced future. That being said, I do think that even if we can not follow through with Thoreau's utopia in its entirety, we could definitely take inspiration from some of the key points he made. We should get rid of the unnecessary material things we hoard like clothes, shoes, decorative items, stationary, etc. Giving up these things would indirectly lead to a better environment. Less clothes and less dishes, for example, would mean less water wasted on cleaning them.
   <br><br>

I also like the point you made about the power college students have in this area. Living away from home really shows how much you actually need to survive. When I moved out here, I brought about 1/3 of my closet, and I was able to make it last the entire year. Everything I ever needed was either in my desk drawers or in my closet, which made looking for stuff easier too, and when packing up to go home or elsewhere, it would only take a few minutes to get everything together.

<br><hr>
I agree with your ideas, and I can really relate to your experience of switching to an eco-friendlier lifestyle. I understand how it feels to cut down daily spending and use low-carbon traffic, just like Thoreau’s minimalism. I obtained a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment when I walked a long way to take the subway to my high school instead of driving, and when I eat more vegetables rather than meat. One thing I really like about Thoreau’s idea is that he does not demonstrate extreme minimalism but encourages people to reduce their consumption. Everyone has desires for convenience and prosperity, however, desiring too much and keeps on fulfilling our desires doesn’t really help us obtain satisfaction, but lowers the level of our happiness. 
   <br><br>
In a way, the development of Internet and consumerism are doing negative effect on people’s life. People can easily see what kind of lives wealthier people are living, which contains a great range of entertainment and consumptions that poor people can not obtain because of their insufficient wealth. This impacts the most on students. When students, for example, of Ken’s generation grew up, some of them might have had the economic ability of accessing those luxuries they longed for, so they might live a rather consumerism life. In contrast, those people who advocates green and healthy way of living mostly come from relatively wealthy families, such as Thoreau. I think it is important for people to understand that happiness is related but not equal to wealth. Blindly pursuing a seemingly better life might not really give you happiness, but probably more desires or even jealousy. If there are more people trying to live like Thoreau, or not necessarily exactly as he did but simply cutting down their daily spending and reduce their desires of unnecessary things, the climate crisis would be less severe. Fewer demand leads to the reduction of production, and carbon emission will be lower.
<br><hr>
Also having read Thoreau before, I always admired his contributions to the minimalist movement. I think previously, his generation was rapidly moving in a direction where “more is better.” However, his insight helped guide people back to a happier, more simplistic lifestyle. His introspection definitely helped me realize how trivial the materialism that rules our society is. 
   <br><br>

I definitely agree with your point about college students. I was very stressed coming into college because I did not know how I would react to the loss of space and privacy that came with having 3 roommates in a tight room. In addition, I had to leave many of my beloved material goods at home. I thought I could never do it. To my surprise, I actually didn’t mind giving up most of my belongings and giving up my queen sized bed for a small twin bunk. It just proved to show how accurate Thoreau was in his theory for happiness. The less I owned, the less I had to take care of and the more timeI had to spend on myself.
   <br><br>

We really are in a prime state to adopt minimalism, especially in the community we live in. IV is completely walkable and it is easy to get to Santa Barbara using public transportation. Having a car is unnecessary. Living at UCSB has shown me that Thoreau’s proposed minimalistic lifestyle is entirely possible, but only if the government provides the funding to restructure cities to encourage this. Otherwise, it will be difficult for most to adopt because of the inconveniences.
<br><hr>

I too, am a huge supporter of the minimalist movement. Although I only dived into it for the first time this year, the small changes I have made regarding the amount of stuff I have has made a significant impact on my life. I haven't bought any new clothes since I have been here at ucsb-a big difference compared to when I would compulsively buy anything at any time.

   <br><br>

I also believe that everyone would be a little happier if they switched to a sustainable lifestyle. Living in smaller places would encourage people to spend more time outside rather than feel trapped inside large, endless homes. In other words, I believe living simply is the key to living happy and healthier.
<br><hr>

I really appreciate your discussion on how college students can be the suitable target audience of the minimalist movement. As the mostly educated generation, it’s crucial for us to live a simplistic and environmentally-friendly lifestyle and pass it on to future generations. Suggested by the book, luxury is a step towards degeneration and its this “child and savage taste for new patterns” that leads to an increasing consuming pattern in the states currently. College is a vital transition which prepares students for entering the adulthood and shapes their views about the society as well as the world. As far as I’m concerned, college life allows me to make budget monthly and record each spending which I’ve never done in the past seventeen years. It allows me to rethink the balance between utility and freshness. The first chapter from the book also teaches us to put necessity in the first place by listing out four basic elements of everyday life: food, shelter, clothing and fuel. Besides, I’m also fascinated by your point on how we can spend these time with our friends to enhance friendship and create more valuable moments. We can also utilize these time to do self-meditation and this will definitely outweigh the happiness and benefits of over-consuming.


<br><hr>
I think college students are kind of forced into a living a sort of minimalist lifestyle. This may not be as simple as what Thoreau encourages but I think the main point is for us to enjoy life rather than the stuff we own. I can see how the minimalism movement has benefits in many different aspects. 
   <br><br>


If you're transitioning to minimalism I think using websites like Depop and Poshmark can be very helpful. As college students we are constantly paying for different things and it feels like we are always scrambling for money, these apps/websites can not only help increase revenue but aid in the process of getting rid of excess stuff. A huge problem that we are facing today is fast fashion. Companies are making clothes in the cheapest way possible in order for us to continually want to buy whatever they keep making. A lot of the times big companies that operate in other countries use harmful dies for their clothes and end up dumping the used dies into water supplies. Buying off of sites where people resale products can reduce your carbon footprint, I know that a large part of my carbon footprint used to come from the amount of clothes I bought/ordered online from big companies. I am transitioning into owning less clothes and also buying more sustainably. I think it makes a lot more sense to have a closet full of clothes that you love and enjoy rather than spend money on junk that you'll wear once or maybe never.


<br><hr>

I strongly agree with your argument above. Personally, after reading the article, I am very surprised about what has Thoreau achieved during that time. I do know about the concept of minimalism, but at the first time I thought that those concepts are just some unpracticed theories made up by some braggarts. I didn’t believe that it is practical and anyone really achieve this. It is amazing that just simply minimizing one’s wants can exert such an impact to the whole world. 

   <br><br>

I admire Thoreau because living in such hard condition can be hard for most people, but he made it nonetheless. Many of us are now addicted to the modern lifestyle along with the convenience that brought with it. I remembered I read about a survey about smartphone addiction online, and the result shows that nearly seventy percent of the younger generations cannot leave their phones away for one day. Technological explosion and Urbanization are a major contributor in our society; however, it can also bring many “side effects” to our environment. I think Thoreau’s action can at least prove that there is a plausible way for people to have a sustainable life style, and eventually to achieve minimalism.
<br><hr>

I also agree with the comments above in the importance of the minimalist approach Henry David Thoreau emphasizes in chapter 1 of Walden. While reading this chapter I felt Thoreau did a good job of creating the narrator in a way in which we felt empathy and sympathy towards him since it seemed as though he was a little hesitant in telling us his unusual story. It’s unusual because he made such costly changes in his life that is not what a typical American would choose to do but changed his life in the best way and this creates hope and urge that we can follow in his footsteps and make a change as well. I like that in the first chapter the narrator advises us to find our definition of society like he did, in a new fresh way discarding the worthless and dehumanizing things in life. If we do this he says we can discover our version of life and is exactly what he achieved. 
   <br><br>

Materialistic things have taken over our society today and people feel it’s a need rather than a want. I also believe that college students do a good job of trying to live a simplistic life do to our situation. Many college students are trying to find ways to save money due to the expenses that our students and our families sacrifice to get an opportunity to receive a college education. Just like Thoreau, we can learn on what he did to live a minimalist lifestyle such as consuming a plant-based diet, have minimal pieces of clothing, minimal furniture or just make sure you have the things you need to survive and nothing more, because at the end that’s all we need, so why overdo it. I believe that if more people in our world take on this minimalist approach, more people might appreciate what we have and our world a little more. This will then help the world also as many good starts living a sustainable lifestyle influencing others to do so as well.
<br><hr>
I too am very interested in the tiny house movement! It honestly stems from another weird obsession: The Sims. A lot of Sims players try and make tiny houses in the game to test their building skills. However, the more I looked into real tiny homes, the more they made sense to me. They are just enough to live comfortably and happily, can be easily transported if need be, and are altogether better for the environment. I enjoy the idea of a tiny house commune, which can give people well-needed space but still utilize the community.
   <br><br>
I completely agree that college students are in a good position to transition to a tinier life. We're already so used to sharing minuscule rooms. (Like so what, Thoreau, you lived in a room in the woods... I've lived in that same room with 2 other girls.) I've cut down my closet so much in the summer between freshman and sophomore year because I know I don't need as much and I'm happy without that stuff.
   <br><br>
Overall, Walden is interesting, if a little preachy. It's worth listening to, but maybe not taking as gospel. There's definitely hints of racism that we could do without, and he doesn't seem to care much for others.
<br><hr>
Thoreau is a typical minimalist. Although he came from a wealthy family, he advocates a simple and natural life and opposes extravagance and waste. Thoreau described in detail in his book the two and two months he spent living in a reclaimed forest on the shores of Lake Walden and his many thoughts during this time. He is particularly opposed to people's pursuit of luxury, which he feels is unnecessary waste. However, in real life, many people are pursuing material luxury, and even blindly follow suit to buy luxury goods. Especially in the overseas study circle where there are many rich people, the wasteful scene is even more serious. So, I agree with Madison that college students should pursue a simple and minimalistic life. Thoreau not only mentioned the need to reduce our personal pursuit and waste of products such as clothing, but also mentioned very similar to Ken's proposal last week: reduce personal carbon emissions. However, this is the idea that Thoreau put forward in the 19th century. We have not realized the importance of simple life by the 21st century.
<br><hr>
I do agree that we have way too much "stuff" than we need. However, a part of me thinks that people should be able to live the way they want to. If someone has a goal in life they want to get to, such as living in a large house or owning a nice, gas-fueled car, I think they have the right to work hard to chase those goals. Obviously, living a more minimal lifestyle would greatly assist the environment, but I am of the opinion that people should get to choose what they do as a result of their hard work. Simply by the way our economic system is set up, people get to choose what they do with their money because they (presumably) worked hard for it.
   <br><br>


Something we can do to assist in a sort of minimalist movement is to influence others in the next generation. If we can lead by example, then we can surely make a difference. If the next generation does not get the chance to learn about or see their parents in an overly lavish lifestyle, they won't yearn for one. Due to the fact that our generation has dabbled in a non-minimalist lifestyle, I wish you good luck trying to convince others to minimize.

<br><hr>


In a society where the materialistic stuff matters a lot to people, I found myself to at times also want things I do not truly need.  While reading  Henry David Thoreau’s “Walden,” I came to understand why being an excessive consumer is not necessary.  I agree with your comment because as a college student myself it is highly important to save up your money.  Having enough expenses to pay for school, it doesn't seem to make sense to me anymore the need to continuously buy things we don't truly need.  Thoreau explained that any additional want for something that is not necessary to have is just an attempt to keep the person satisfied.  I find that Thoreau's nineteenth-century views should be applied by more people in today's society because we as consumers are not being wise to keep our planet safe.
<br><hr>
I agree. The literature always relates to the real world. In Thoreau's lifetime, the industrial revolution starts in for a while. People's material desire was stimulated by the development of technology. Comparing with the self-sufficiency agriculture lifestyle, the new lifestyle has more extra time. People choose to fill the void with things. 

   <br><br>

Thoreau died pretty early. He even did not see the post-industrial revolution era. He did not satisfy the people of his era. The 21 century will only be worse. It also depends on the experience of his childhood. If he is born at the end of 20 century in a developing nation with a lower-class family, there is a chance that he may accept the current situation. People only will care a big picture or other people's life when they live good or have a good life quality before.

<br><hr>
I also think college students exist in a very unique point in their lives where a shift to a more minimal and simplistic lifestyle would be beneficial and, hopefully, long-lasting. The conditions that many of us live in here in IV are very constrained as you mention. Many of us are fiscally limited in what we can do or not do, but that is not always such a bad thing. We are forced to share houses and, oftentimes, bedrooms with others, and I have personally enjoyed these living circumstances. House size, or even room size for that matter, is not important if you don't want it to be. I am from Boston and I have personally visited Walden Pond. I have seen the cabin Thoreau lived in for his Transcendental journey. While it was a modest little cabin, it wasn't an unpleasant home by any means. It did what a home is supposed to do, and thats it. We need to remember that people have been living on this Earth for centuries, and a lot of the things people back then had have come to mean very different things then they do now. 

   <br><br>

I commend Thoreau for his willingness to let go of material things and really appreciate that he was so vocal about this issue as far back as the 1850s when people were not remotely concerned about these issues of stuff. Today, however, this is a big issue, and I think our culture is creating an association between happiness and stuff that is unhealthy for people and is also unsustainable for our environment. I hope that college students can become proponents of this lifestyle, and see not only the monetary benefits of a minimalist and simple life, but also see that life can be enjoyed without the overwhelming presence of material goods.

<br><hr>

After my first couple of months of living in the dorms, I really do think a lot of college students would benefit from minimalism. I sometimes find myself cluttered and stressed by the amount of "stuff" I keep in my small room. I'm also an awful impulse buyer when it comes to clothes, and turn to retail therapy when I'm stressed. After really reading up on the impacts of my actions, I realized that the environmental impact is huge. I've since begun buying from thrift stores when I need to fuel my habit, and giving clothes to friends when I have no more space in my closet.
   <br><br>


Personally, I don't think I could go all of the way to minimalism. I think I could definitely try and cut back on the amount of clutter I have and the number of things I buy, but I really do admire people who can go all of the way and I'm working to be less attached to the clutter around me. I do think everyone needs to take something away from the minimalists because I feel like their message was a lot less about telling people how to live, and more of a focus on human happiness in a capitalistic society. I feel like Thoreau thought about that too! And if living more sustainably can impact our moods and wellness, then I feel like it's fair to say it's a better way of living.

   <br><br>

I think the Walden experiment has a lot to give to modern society, I think it would have to be adapted to fit today's limitations. Obviously, we can't all up and move and try to build a house next to a pond, but I think we can all try to be more sustainable. Maybe gardening, composting, taking public transportation, etc. I feel like being sustainable is "trendy" right now, so if the environmentalist movement capitalizes on this trend and continues to push it, who knows where we'll be!
<br><hr>


I do think that living a minimalist life would benefit me. I constantly am buying more clothes because I want to fit in with the latest fashions. At this point, I have more clothes than I know what to do with and yet I still want to buy more. The sad thing is when I buy new clothes it only makes me happy for a few days. I believe that if I started a more minimalist life I would be happier. I would spend less time thinking about what I was going to wear or worrying about the appearance. I would spend less time doing laundry and constantly cleaning up my closet. With more time I could get my work done sooner and be able to hang out with my friends. Not only would a minimalist life benefit me, but it would also benefit the environment.  I would be eating vegetarian and buying the stuff I need rather than the stuff I want. 
   <br><br>
I think many people need to have the same outlook as Thoreau. Nowadays everyone is focused on having more stuff than everyone else. They want the biggest houses and the fanciest cars. They spend their whole lives chasing a goal that can never be reached. They would be a lot happier if the appreciated the little things and spent less money.

<br><hr>

I agree that college students are in a prime situation to start their minimalist journey, due to their common lack of money in their wallet and space in their closet. However the difference between that and what Thoreau is saying in Walden is that he is doing it by choice. He chose to live in a secluded home for two years, with limited space and belongings, although he could be living much more lavishly. This is the same idea as the Minimalist guys, who have an income that could give them a larger house with more stuff, but they chose to only keep what is truly serving a purpose to their life. 
   <br><br>
Thoreau suggests that this minimalism lifestyle is a choice, and one that will truly pay off. As opposed to the typical American mindset of always desiring more and better, he believes that the less you want, the less you need, and the happier you are. A quote that stuck out to me was him saying that his “greatest skill has been to want but little.” Very few people can say that they truly want little, and because of that Thoreau is calling it a skill. A skill is something everyone can learn and develop over enough time and dedication, so if people put some effort into rethinking their priorities, they too can become skilled in this way. When people are so obsessed with getting the newest and best thing out there, they will never truly be happy because there is no cap to the newest and best thing. There will always be a hole they are trying to fill in order to find this missing happiness. Although I have zero intentions of pulling a Thoreau and living alone in the woods, I do think that this reading left something with me. I believe that if you can train your mind into wanting less, you will in turn feel like you have everything you need to be happy. In all honesty, you do not need many physical things to be happy, so if we could just remind ourselves of that every once in a while, I think all of us would be better off - and of course our environment would be better off too.

<br><hr>
I agree that the minimalist movement can have a huge impact not only on one’s climate footprint, but also one’s quality of life. I sometimes find myself stressed by the societal pressure to consume. I think that I need the newest pair of shoes or the newest iPhone. But buying these things won’t make me happy. If we can learn to let go of the need to keep revamping our collection of stuff, we can be happier with what we already have. I find myself thrown into the minimalist lifestyle when I am backpacking. I take with me everything that I need, and nothing that I don’t. I find that I am the most content with myself when I don’t have to worry about “stuff”, and can just enjoy the beauty that our world has to offer. Make a list of things that make you happy in your life. I highly doubt that material things will fall very high on that list.
   <br><br>


A bit of a tangent, but I think that getting out into nature is a great way to find inspiration to make more sustainable lifestyle changes. The most beautiful places I’ve seen cannot only be accessed by foot, and it makes me feel more motivated to live in a way that will preserve our precious environment. I also agree that being a college student provides us great segways to start to “declutter” our lives. Many of my friends are into thrifting, as well as sharing clothes with each other so we don’t have to keep buying new outfits for events that we will only wear once. And it saves money! I think Thoreau’s ideas can be adapted and applied to our modern way of living. Obviously we can’t all go live in a small cabin in the woods, but we can and should be more conscious about our consuming habits and the motivations behind them.
<br><hr>

Given the tumultuous time we live in now, it is perhaps more important than ever to follow the minimalist lifestyle and have joy in the small amount of things one possesses. While Thoreau's words came from 170 years ago, it is still very relevant today. Too often have we sailed away from minimalism and pursued things beyond our reach: a larger house, a fancier car, or an ambitious target that's simply too much for one individual to achieve...The reality, however, is that we are spending a lot of time and money on things we are stressed out about, not the things that truly make us happy.
   <br><br>

While I'm perfectly content with the idea of minimalism - in fact, I echo with it in many ways, I'm not sure if it will be easy to persuade the public to switch out of the consumption-first western worldview. Sadly we've made this our social norm, and any attempt to suggest a smaller house or less spending will be seen as a violation of freedom, and therefore won't receive many votes in the political process. Maybe the second half of the course will change my mind on this, but the pessimistic side of me tends to think that people today are too selfish and greedy to adapt Thoreau's wisdom...The unfortunate truth is that many (especially the boomer generation) have been held capture by the consumer culture, and unless the youth take over in terms of political representation, minimalism will never become the societal norm.

<br><hr>
I too kind of thought of how we college students can make the transition into a minimalist lifestyle now when we tend to live in smaller spaces, like the residence halls or small apartments, to make it easier to maintain the lifestyle as we move on. I totally agree that I would help save money if we didn’t fixate ourselves on materialistic things and instead opened our eyes to realize we would do just fine without them.  
   <br><br>

on another note, I’ve been watching a ton of “Tiny House” decoration videos on YouTube because a video came up on my recommended page once, and I was very intrigued. The houses are so simple yet complex, so tiny yet so spacious at the same time. I think they’re pretty cute and it could be something our society could transition’s into for better housing. 
<br><hr>


I strongly agree with your comment about the unique situation college students are in to introduce minimalism into their own lives as well as the importance of minimalism. Many students share bedrooms with at least one other person, which compared to the lifestyle that many of us lived at home, is much more cramped and there is less space for stuff that you don’t need. I feel that as soon as people give up their need to conform to societal trends and let go of materialistic desires, it is easy to see the benefits of minimalism and adopt them into everyday life. I also liked how Thoreau explained that many items are easy to acquire and hard to get rid of. At times, I have found myself buying clothes that in the moment seem like a great investment since they are trendy, however a few months later, I will find that piece buried in the back of my closet untouched and sometimes, even still with the tag on it. Even then I may still have a hard time giving up the piece of clothing since it is something that I spent my clothing on and it has some value or sentiment to me. One way to avoid getting sucked into the trends of fashion is to stop shopping at places that support fast fashion and start building filling your wardrobe with clothes you buy from thrift or consignment stores. Luckily, these days thrift stores and buying second hand have become part of the “trend” that many people follow and not only is it sustainable, but is also less expensive.

Although I too believe that minimalism can greatly help our environment, I think that it will be hard to convince people to give up their lavish homes and expensive cars to adopt a lifestyle that exists off of the idea of having exactly what you need, no more no less. In America we have the that more is better and like in class, many people connect the idea of success with materialism. Although I think that everyone would benefit from adopting a minimalist lifestyle, I do not think that people will give up their selfish needs and materialistic greed in order to help their suffering planet.
<br><hr>
I find the minimalist lifestyle to be very fascinating and I am always watching videos about it on YouTube. I also enjoy watching videos about people who talk about what it's like to live in a tiny house or even in a van. I feel like that lifestyle is just so much simpler which in turn makes life easier to enjoy. Recently I have been paying more attention to how much money I am spending on little things and have cut back a ton. For such a long time I never really thought about where I was spending my money and what I was spending it on. Now that I a two years into college I find that I am much more frugal than I once was and do not buy unnecessary things anymore. I would like to do more to take up this lifestyle and I believe that everyone should try to as well.

I believe you make very good points in your comment but unlike you I struggle with the idea of being very minimalistic. After this reading and class I begin understand how this trigger of mine to try and be very simplistic could have been engraved in my head from advertisements and American culture in general. Growing up I always in a way understood success as being related to being very wealthy, and having the biggest house, traveling on airplanes and owning many cars. Of course, today I determine success by different means and I understand that all that I mentioned are great contributors to carbon emissions. As time goes on I begin to reflect on my spending habits and how I like to live and I notice partners that are not very simple. The fact of living with just the necessities is something very strange to me, I notice I mistake the definition of need with want. I don't have to or need to get all the things that I want or already possess but I just desire them, and I find myself falling into this very consumeristic mentality. I am beginning to learn that I have to change my habits and separate myself from those bad mindsets that have been implanted in my had of what I "need" to have in order to be successful or live a happy life. In this modern age its very hard to live simple because everything around is so not "simple." You are thrown with so many advertisements everyday in our life and we are constantly on the move whether physically or virtually. This article definitely served as a reminder to slow down a bit and try to really find what makes me happy and if it really involves in having all these unnecessary "stuff."

If Thoreau could see the ever-expanding consumer market we have today in the United States, he would surely write a thorough paper criticizing and presenting the urgency for the human race to embrace minimalism. With the development of fast fashion, the adoption of a “bigger equals better” lifestyle, and a scripted life we must uphold to be accepted in society, I personally feel like it is a difficult challenge to go against what society advertises as “success.” After reading Thoreau’s work, I am both intrigued and compelled by his ability to survive in the wilderness with nothing but an ax and his bare hands. I also liked how he listed out the cost of his house and the amount of money he gained from farming to prove how his simplistic life is sustainable.

Thoreau divides the necessities of life into four categories: food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. He also makes a statement that many people will not want to hear, “Many of the luxuries in the world are hindrances to the elevation of mankind.” When we stop to look at the current food production and consumption, it is clear that we are producing a lot of food and wasting a lot of it. People are addicted to the “live to eat” rather than the “eat to live” lifestyle. It is because of this lifestyle that companies are able to produce an overload of food and still make profits even if it is wasted. The “all you can eat” (ACYE) style restaurants are able to survive because of our intense craving for food. Meanwhile, Thoreau is living off of his land and consuming just enough to be satisfied and to make a profit. If we could strive to adopt Thoreau’s outlook on food we could drastically reduce our impacts on the climate. Thoreau promotes a vegetable-based diet which will reduce the level of greenhouse gas emissions from the demands for the production of meat. Next, big lavish mansions have become the “dream house” for many Americans. Thoreau lived in a small wooden cabin that he built himself. Although it is not big, it is certainly enough for a single individual like him. However, in the present day, rich Americans are living in mansions by themselves or with only two or three people. The “bigger equals better” lifestyle dominates our view on shelter. Fast fashion is another example of how we are too consumed with what society shoves down our throats. The fear of missing out on the latest trend or not wearing something that will receive the approval of others would be ludicrous to Thoreau. Thoreau seemingly predicts the rise of fast fashion as he says “every generation laughs at old fashions but follows religiously the new.” However, instead of “every generation” it is now the same generation on a bi-monthly basis. The important takeaway from Thoreau is that focusing too much on material things and achieving excess in possessions is bad for the individual.

I agree with you that Thoreau’s simplistic lifestyle is superior to the “bigger is better” mindset that is deeply prevalent in Western society. I find Thoreau’s work inspirational and impressive. Like you mention, he divides our necessities into four categories including: food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. The dream houses you described are regarded highly to most Americans. Many adults are proud to flaunt their giant mansions, as they claim it is a reward for all of their hard work and income. However, the “bigger equals better” lifestyle does not correlate to one’s happiness. I find Thoreau’s promotion for simplistic lifestyle extremely compelling. The happiest time of my life was when I had the smallest amount of possessions. At this time, I lived out of my backpack for a month, only taking with me what I needed to survive in the Alaskan backcountry. My instructors who traveled with me, never live in a permanent home, as they are outdoors 11 months out of the year. However, in my 20 years of life they are some of the most content people I have met thus far. One thing I will always remember is when I asked my instructor if she will ever want to settle down and live in a home. Her response was, “Eventually I will, but I will never live in a space larger than what is essential because a big home is excessive space which people feel the need to fill with unnecessary belongings.” My instructors could definitely be considered minimalists, as they have very little belongings, and yet they seem to be living their lives fuller than most. This is because they have not followed the roles that were scripted for them like Ken had described in his lecture and Thoreau advertises in his book.

I like how you mentioned the comparison between living to eat and eating to live. While food is good and people use meals as a social activity and leisure time, it is done in a way that is both unhealthy for the people and for the environment. Because of the living to eat outlook, people are wasting food, eating in excess and in doing so they are harming the environment. This harm could be avoided if everyone lived like Thoreau and ate only what they  actually needed along with choosing to eat on a plant based diet that is better for our planet. But that is easier said than done for most burger-loving Americans. 
   <br><br>
It is also crazy to think about the want and longing for unnecessarily large mansions and excessive amounts of expensive cars and other stuff. What I find really interesting is that people dream about having big fancy houses, but I don’t really understand why. No one needs a house that big and it won’t make you any better of a person or any happier, but people are so focused on gaining materialistic value that they are blind to what real joy and contentment actually is. This blindness in a way reduces our quality of life without us even realizing it. We are raised to work hard in school, so we can go to college, so we can get a good job, so we can make a lot of money. All for what? To buy bigger and “better” stuff? While I would love to say that I am not a victim of this vicious cycle of consumerism and materialism, it is hard to do so, as everyone today seems to be intertwined in this culture in some way. What needs to happen in order for things to change is the realization of everyone that our lives shouldn’t be so focused on buying stuff and should be more focused on becoming a better person and living a happy life with only what you need and not what you want. This change comes back to Thoreau’s idea that people must open up to change and discover for themselves the right way for them, as individuals, to live their lives. Instead of falling into this cycle of materialism and consumerism, we, as individual people, need to decide what matters most to us and what we absolutely need. Once we are able to do this, we will thank ourselves and so will our planet.

After reading Walden, I saw how Thoreau had a different view of life than most people. He didn't depend on objects to bring him happiness. He was frugal and lived in moderation. I agree with your comments about Thoreau and how different most peoples' lifestyles are from Thoreau. I liked this quote from him: "In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain one's self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we will live simply and wisely..." It made me think about how a simpler life can give someone happiness. We don't need to live extravagant lives or work to the bone to buy expensive things.  Walden says that some people "go to the other side of the globe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote themselves to trade for ten or twenty years, in order that they may live--that is, keep comfortably warm--and die in New England at last." Is it worth it to spend so much time and effort, working from dusk to dawn, in order to live a good life? We should try to find happiness in the simpler things in life. You don't have to buy the newest car to be happy.

Consumerism, materialism and the lust for money fame and possessions can of course be toxic things and are currently harming our society - and the environment in many ways. The truth is though humanity has benefitted immensely from these tendencies. I would argue that it is in the nature of human to just want more. If it wasn't then, how can we explain all that is around us, how we of all animals thrived and built the world that we live in today. It is in our nature to ask for more of ourselves and of everyone who is around us, and it is very difficult to satisfy the human thirst for glory, because it goes much further than the primitive needs for food and shelter.
   <br><br>

On the other hand it would do the world so much good to abide by the principles that the way of living proposed in the  book stand for. We should better understand material possessions for what they are, and our relation to them. The way the consumerist mindset has gripped society has been swift and all-encompassing, and we need to rethink our relationship to our possessions. This can only be done through nourishing our spirit, and becoming more aware and mindful creatures. A better more sustainable way of life that is in sync with nature and all it encompasses can only stem from understanding that we are all one, and this comes from deep, meditative thinking, spiritual enlightenment and mindfulness.

I agree with your statement about rethinking our relationship to material possessions (you replied to one of my previous comments – yes, I am Greek – ti kaneis;) Thoreau’s account of his experience is quite profound. To give up the modern conveniences for his time in order to live a more simplistic life in theory seems great. In practice, especially in the 21st century in the United States, living a life like Thoreau’s would be extremely difficult. I can only speak for myself, but from a young age I learned to be attached to stuff. I was conditioned to consume most of what the world has to offer. Now as an adult, I’m discovering that material possessions don’t fulfill my basic needs and I no longer have the desire for my life to be consumed with material things. 
    <br><br>

Like you stated, our relationship to possessions needs to be analyzed. Asking questions like why I desire a large house, why I desire these new articles of clothing, etc. may help someone realize that those are wants, not needs. I would hope that logic would convince the person not to give in to his/her/their desires. Not buying a large house, brand new clothing, etc. would not only save that person money, but also decrease their carbon footprint, which is vital to mitigating humans’ impact on climate change.

Henry David Thoreau lived in the past, in the time when the earth was not as bad as it is right now. In his work Walden, Thoreau describes the time when he built a cabin in the woods, lived as a vegan, listened to the nature. His life in Walden was simple. The cabin he built in his spare time costs $28.12-1/2 dollars in total with limited furniture. It was a small, concise, but soft and sweet house. There was no renter alerting him for the rent each month. While people in the modern society work all the day for a furnished house, Thoreau had begun his life as a minimalist. Nobody could say that he did not enjoy his life beside Walden. Some farmers nearby him used to ask for his loneliness, but he did not really feel lonely. Thoreau slept with twinkle stars at night, woke up by the sings of birds. He planed about two acres of beans with small potatoes, peas, and turnips to feed up with himself. It was a ease and peaceful life, and it is in the opposite of our livelihood nowadays. 
    <br><br>

People in the modern society are exploiting and consuming resources on the earth. We barely listen to the call of the nature like Thoreau but focus on electronic devices like phones and TVs. The images and pictures appearing on Instagram have replaced nature scene. We lived in a seemingly busy, but meaningless life.

I completely agree and also think the fact that his cabin cost him $28 is so important. People in California are spending tens of millions of dollars on these insanely vast homes that only are housing a family of four. The amount of energy and money going into these homes is ridiculous and not needed for such a small number of people. They build these huge homes, only for their children to grow up, move out, and then build a house similar to the one that they grew up in. There is also so much time that gets spent on this housing process. People will spend years figuring out how they want their house to look, years building it, months to years decorating it, when all this time they could have spent thinking of ways their house could be more eco-friendly instead of destroying the environment. Also, these houses that are so huge on the ocean will just fall off eventually.

When reading Walden, Economy I was reminded of the story of Buddha. I will not pretend to be well versed in the story but the main themes that I can recall now seem very concurrent with the message of Walden. Essentially, the strive for luxury seems to only cause pain and suffering. While the story of Buddha focuses on the personal suffering caused by desire, Thoreau focuses on how suffering is caused on a larger scale by the pursuit of greater luxuries. I enjoyed the way Ken likened this pursuit of luxury to a script that has been written out by us. He mentions that his generation not only followed their own script but expanded up on it, while also telling us in the same breath that we must not do this. Do as I say not as I do seems to be good advise in this situation, however, I am curious to understand how exactly we are to separate luxury from our lifestyle at this point in time. So much of our daily lives is reliant  on developing and acquiring these luxuries that the concepts of economy and extravagance have become immeasurably codependent. Likewise, this desire for luxury has also prompted much of our development and advancement as a civilization. For example, many intelligent individuals choose to become doctors because it pays well, those doctors in-turn make medical advancements that save lives, innovate the medical field, and extend the human lifespan. Sure, Thoreau could live in a small cabin off of his four basic necessities, however, say he fell ill, he would have to return to civilization in order to receive medical attention, medical attention that would not be available outside of an organized and advanced civilization. I want to envision a simpler world with an emphasis on the basic needs of life, however, I struggle to see the realism in what Ken is asking of us.

When reading this chapter, I also thought Thoreau’s findings sounded familiar. Your comparison to the story of Buddah was very insightful and illustrated how a constant theme, throughout hundreds of years, has been people striving for an unattainable, luxurious lifestyle. The point made about our greedy lifestyle leading to the advancement of science and medical help is extremely valid. While reading Thoreau’s call to action I didn’t think about what would have happened if he became ill on his two year escape from developed civilization. I think Thoreau’s points are important, as humans do overuse life’s luxuries, like clothing. But, I also agree that at this point in society it would be extremely difficult to reverse our lives to that of Thoreaus, and could be seen as a step backwards toward the advanced civilization we have attained. I believe a solution to this would be in the middle-ground: having a smaller home, wasting less food, buying less clothes, etc. Yet, this still poses the problem of our current climate state and how small changes in our lifestyle can’t stop this dooming reality.


<br><hr>

My knowledge of the story of Buddha is not as well versed as I would like, so do correct me if I am wrong, but I remember it going somewhere along the line of how when Buddha first set out to rid himself of the worldly desires, he went to the extreme of eating only nuts and fruits that he found off the ground and drinking water only from the streams. This made him extremely weak and unable to concentrate on his quest. Thus he realized not eating enough will not help him and started to eat normally again (only enough to make himself full I guess, not wasting food). Only then did he achieve enlightenment. I think Thoreau's example of living in the woods is a little extreme, but I think what Ken is asking of us is more like the Minimalists in the documentary, to have only what we need to have to live and thrive. If my recollection of Buddha is correct, then we can still have hospitals and doctors because they aren't some luxury items; they are essential to life. However, I do agree with you in terms of how money and stuff are incentives to push us further as a civilization, but I don't think the sole reason that smart people become doctors and make medical advancements is because of money. I think those people to some extent (although money is one of the obvious factors), do care for human beings and I'm sure they will pursue to innovate the field of medicine even if money is out of the equation.  Scientists are naturally curious, after all. Obviously, after years of advancement humans have developed a higher standard of living; we aren't some Neanderthals living in caves anymore, but there is a fine line between what we really need and what we think we need. We do need shelter, food, water, healthcare, indoor plumbing, and toiletries. Louis Vuitton bags and Supreme shirts? Maybe not so much.

<br><hr>
Perhaps my comment was an oversimplified version of my point. First off, I would like to note that of course we could, as a society, cut out the "Louis Vuitton bags and Supreme shirts." Unfortunately, there are two fundamental flaws with the proposed version of minimalism presented by Thoreau and Ken: the healthcare industry, and other essential industries, are MOST DEFINITELY motivated by money and development MOST DEFINITELY requires luxury. To my first point, clearly you have good health care and/or have never had to go to an ER in a country where healthcare is universal because I have encountered numerous anecdotes of unmotivated healthcare professionals. Personally, one of my close friends waited 3 days to have his leg reset in Canada after he broke it and my aunt died of malpractice in a kaiser hospital (kaiser is a notably affordable form of insurance which also shockingly translates to poor healthcare). Famous people can live a full lifespan with HIV (Magic Johnson) while poor individuals can die of AIDS in a few decades in the SAME COUNTRY. The only factor there is money. Additionally, the only way that we, as a society, have been able to branch of into any other profession besides agriculture is because of mass production. Food is mass produced --> no need to focus life on food --> learn more things. I am not advocating against a more minimalist culture (for example, I think the lifestyle in the documentary is a very positive way to live), but im also not going to advocate against reality.
<br><hr>
First of all I am really sorry that your aunt died because of poor hospital care. It is a given that (at this point in time) that the more money you have the better service you will receive. So while Magic Johnson is living happily with a deadly virus, while pooer people die for much less. That's why presidential candidates (Democrats) are running for Universal Healthcare, making health services with a (better) standard for all, even ones without top-notched insurance like your aunt. Don't get me wrong, Universal Healthcare has many problems of its own, as you have shown with Canada, but I do think it is the correct path that we should go as a nation to slowly stop getting motivated by money and be more motivated by helping other human beings. This is an extremely difficult thing to do because at least with money, you know what you are working towards. Helping other people, yeah I mean you will feel kinda happy that you helped them, but there is no materialistic proof to congratulate you for your work. It makes you feel unappreciated and thus discourages you from doing it. I completely understand what you mean by the reality of it, like why would I just drop everything that I have achieved so far to go live in a hut with minimal incentives and then have no motivation to contribute to society because even though I can buy a big house I am forcing myself to live in a hut. It's a huge brick wall that people (and myself as well, not gonna lie) are not able to jump over. But Buddha was able to get over it because he got rid of his worldly desires (money, fame), and still was able to help society because the incentives didn't interest him anymore. It's like a modified version of the Golden Rule, like treat others how you would like to be treated, but don't expect them to treat you nicely in return. The same principle applies here: Still help society because you can, but don't expect society to give you a big house and money in return. How do you do that? Well, don't spend money on unnecessary things and only live with what you need. This will put many mass-producing companies out of business because people are buying less, and thus lowering our carbon footprint. I think this also ties into your reasoning of "Food is mass-produced---> no need to focus on food-->learn more things" Yeah this reasoning is true for the ones that are receiving the food ( 1st world countries), but what about the people that are working in the fields to produce food? Aren't we taking away their opportunities to learn by making them work 7 days a week to keep up with our demands? For all we know there could have been a genius working in the field who could have solved world hunger with the proper education. This is similar in how Thoreau describes his townsmen whose through their misfortunes inherited a farm. I used to think that the only reason I got this far in life because I worked hard and got where I am, but now I realized that I'm only here because I was born with loving parents and didn't suffer much growing up. Many other people in the world sadly weren't as lucky as I am. So yeah, reality sucks because the generation before us has shaped the world into their view of consumerism and materialism, so now it is up to us to change it. By the way, please do not take my comments as acts of aggression because I had to emphasize some points to help them go across. I am in no way trying to attack, only trying to convey my opinion. I genuinely enjoyed this conversation and I hope it is the same for you.

I’ve always been a fan of Henry David Thoreau’s work during because ideas showed a shift in thinking among people and how we need to live a life of self reliance with the bare minimum for survival and not be subject to depending on lavish, material things. I like the notion that he is the grandfather of the minimalist perspective. The fact that he had this idea of simplification and that this was the key to a successful life because the bare minimum for survival should be enough for the average American even when he was living during a time where the luxuries we have today weren’t available really says something about our current society. He turns our attention, like Ken says, to focus on the role we were given since our birth. Even before we are born, we are already predestined to be a puzzle piece in our parents lives. Some are born into wealth and some are not which really spells out how the rest of your life is going to be and the things you are surrounded with which we become reliant on. 
<br><br>

I do believe Thoreau is on to something so early on before the luxuries that are around today came about. The commentary and process he takes us through as he is writing the first chapter of “Walden” is fascinating and makes the reader think “what are the necessities for life” or even “what do I need to get me through today”. If he were around to see our lifestyle and culture today, he would scorn us because not only is our culture built on material things hat are practically useless, but he would be most ashamed in the fact in how those material things have shaped our personalities. He would say that we’ve submitted too easily to the roles we were born into and even expected more from them. He would agree with the notion that simplification is the answer but he would also be super skeptical if we could even begin to do that since we’re way too dependent and naive when it comes to material things. There may be no hope for his idea of living a self reliant lifestyle with the things we’ve already been accustomed to our entire lives along with our unwillingness to give them up.

I agree with your perception of Thoreau’s work and about society today. Many people today rely on the things we’ve grown up with and can’t imagine life without them. For example, most people rely on their phones constantly, and while they are helpful when it comes to reaching someone in an emergency, we rely on them for more than just that. We rely on them for entertainment, shopping, and even school. Thoreau could probably not even imagine the amount of time we spend using our phones or even other electronics. 

<br><br>

We have become so used to so many things we don’t need to survive. Many people have big houses and tons of clothes. We see the lives of celebrities who even give their children a huge wardrobe that they’ll grow out of in a year, and while we know it’ unnecessary, many people couldn’t imagine their lives without these items and wouldn’t want to sacrifice them. Thoreau’s work really just shows we don’t need these big houses or tons of clothes and we can live off the necessities, for much cheaper too. Another plus side in cutting down on all the extra items is that it would help decrease our output of greenhouse gases which would help our planet.


<br><hr>
I agree with your statement about Thoreau; if he were to see modern-day America, he would be disappointed in the materialistic lifestyle that Americans had adopted. He would definitely assume that we as a society ignored his philosophy of self-reliance and simplicity. Although I was not really a fan of Henry David Thoreau’s work because, well, reading, I am really glad that I was (although forced) exposed to his work, Walden and Civil Disobedience were the primary works that we read, during my sophomore, junior, and senior (AP or Pre-AP) English Language and Literature classes in high school. Even in the mid-1800s, the idea of minimalist living was imminent, or maybe it was already happening within a community. Granted, the time that this was written was around 200 years ago; people didn’t rely on the modern technologies that we have and American consumerism wasn’t as economically prosperous as it is now. Despite the major differences in the periods, one thing is similar: Thoreau wanted to tell his audience that even though our lives are predestined, we can create for ourselves a minimalist life where we can depend only on our true necessities. According to Thoreau, our necessities are “for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the vital heat in us”; essentially, we just need to survive even if it’s the bare minimum as long as it’s enough.

The world we live in today is so centered around the benefits of technology and capitalism that I honestly think it will be really hard to rely on the pure form of minimalism that Thoreau suggests. It's a very extreme form of minimalism that will be almost impossible to implement to daily lives as our society has been introduced to and reliant upon computers and smart phones. I do have optimism that the concept of reusable fashion and vegetarianism can be implemented as it is currently an easy replacement and people are halfway there already. Though, Thoreau's work should be taken lightly and not literally. In my opinion, following Thoreau's story is an extreme that the world will have difficulty following. But, I agree that his advice should be kept in mind when purchasing from fast fashion and consuming large amounts of red meat. I just think that the concept of minimalism illustrated in Thoreau's book is extremely hard to follow in today's technology dependent world. Not only is it hard, but it will take a long time to implement successfully. But, I do have optimism in that people should consider his advice and slowly make our way to more minimal life, as close as we can get to Thoreau's story.

You are correct in saying that it will be a difficult task, especially as Ken described it, our role given to us from past generations pressures us to continue to prescribe to their practices.  These are very harmful practices and have only gotten worse throughout the generations as technology and materialistic societal norms only intensify.  However, as you stated there is hope.  Some of the practices that Thoreau advocated and practiced in Walden have become implemented in the lives of many including vegetarianism and sustainable fashion.  There are even some people who employ a version of his minimalism lifestyle into their lives and live that way.  Even though Thoreau provides a very extreme example that people won’t be able to follow exactly, he does show people the right direction to move in, towards simplicity.  We must combat the materialistic society in which we have grown up to become the change that this world needs to see.  That means buy less clothes and those that are more sustainable (high quality and lower impact), live in smaller homes that don’t have all that empty space where all you can do is buy more stuff to fill it, and buying food that is local and seasonal, only buying what you need and minimizing waste.  We really need to change the way society is run and inspire simplicity in all aspects of our lives.  This will create less waste and a decline in the materialistic needs.  As such, we can work to decrease our impact on the environment.  It only takes one to change and each person can make changes in their personal life that can help.  This will mean buying what you need, and not always what you want.  However, this less materialistic approach can also lead to increasing happiness because then there is the opportunity to focus on what means the most in life, for example building stronger relationships with family and friends or enjoying a variety of activities that bring joy.  It transfers finding happiness in objects to finding it in oneself and what positive impact they can leave throughout their lives.  The journey may be difficult but any progressive change we can make is improving the world for the better.

I agree with some of the points you made in your comments. I believe that we should treat Thoreau’s experience as a kind of suggestion, rather than a template. As being ecocentric and critic of consumerism, Walden introduces a concept of minimalism to the audience. For example, as a person without any financial difficulties, Thoreau lived in a little cabin build by himself. He also believed that a box with several holes on it would be enough for a person to live in. However, compared with the Minimalism introduced in the documentary this week, Thoreau’s method was much too extreme. Being obsessed with today’s modern life, most people have lost their ability to live in nature as Thoreau did. It will take a long time to achieve this goal. Moreover, damage might also be caused to nature if too many people imitate his approach. In this way, many problems in cities will be brought to nature. I am not saying that all the points mentioned in Walden are outdated or useless. Thoreau pointed the right direction for us. Although we don't have to be as extreme as he is, we should jump out of the comfort zone. When facing fast fashion and diet choice, keep in mind what we have learned from Thoreau’s Walden.

I agree with your statement that Thoreau’s lifestyle isn’t attainable for most people in today’s time, mainly because we are so dependent on technology. I liked how you pointed out that there are other ways we can cut back such as through avoiding fast fashion and by cutting out red meat. I too am hopeful that once people start cutting back with examples such as these, that they will embrace a more minimalist lifestyle that we all desperately need to transition to. Thoreau was an extremist in his mission to live in the woods and survive off of the bare necessities. But I also don’t 100% agree with his tactics because last quarter in English 22, Professor Ken discussed with us that Thoreau started a craze of people moving to the wilderness. This caused an abundance of people living in the so called wilderness. So while I don’t agree with Thoreau’s tactics I appreciate his dedication to the minimalist lifestyle. I also liked your point that Thoreau’s experience in Walden shouldn’t be taken literally because it isn’t an option that we can take today.

If Thoreau could see our society today I believe he would be quite disappointed in our extreme greed and selfishness.

-       Reading about Walden’s journey of becoming a minimalist was somewhat shocking and extremely interesting. Although being a minimalist does not have to be so extreme for everyone, Thoreau brings up some of Walden’s key ideas of being a minimalist. The over-arching idea of going “back to a nature lifestyle” is probably shocking to most American citizens so reading what Walden did is probably extremely uncomfortable to imagine for them. When Thoreau challenged us to think about the role we were so called “given at birth,” that resonated with me. Although it is not our fault what kind of life we were born and raised to live, it is our own choices now that affect us and the environment.

-       The main ideas that stood out in this chapter were that of being more self-reliant in life, maintaining more values of simplicity in materialistic life, and reconsidering the idea of progress or success. I genuinely think that trying to be more simplistic in everyday life like eating less, buying less, using less should be the first step that every person can take to better the environment.

I also found Thoreau's idea about challenging the roles we are born with (as Ken mentions in this video) quite interesting and in fact inspiring. It feels like with the start of every new generation, they have to be bigger and better than the generation that precedes them. Or at least it seems that way when we look at our parents and grandparents. Each one of them, when they are born, are told that they need to work hard so that their children are born with a better chance at surpassing their parents’ level of “success.” We are born into a role that requires us to work even harder than our parents so we can make even more money, live in even larger houses, and own more things. It’s a cycle we are trapped in and Thoreau urges us to challenge and break this cycle. And it is up to our generation to reject these scripts and make the change in leading a more simplistic lifestyle.

    His critique of consumerism and materialism is insightful. He’s right, we don’t need to be constantly buying articles of clothing because what we have now is “out of style.” We should only own the amount necessary to survive. I know this is a hard fact to face, trust me as someone who loves clothing and shopping, this is has been very hard to come to terms with, but it must be dealt with. I have gotten much better at not falling into the traps of consumerism, as sometimes I will see a cute top and want to buy it, but then I ask myself: do I really need this to survive? Will my life be drastically improved by owning this top?, and then answer is always no. At the end of the day, simple is the only way to go. I can only imagine what Thoreau would think if he could see some of the lifestyle choices of people now.

Henry David Thoreau's Walden explains his experience living a completely minimalistic life at Walden Pond for about two years. I first read Walden in high school and really identified with Thoreau's lifestyle. Thoreau discusses the four necessities in life being food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. He explains how these factors are the bare minimum for survival and anything more lavish is unnecessary. Although this book was published in 1854, the values and ideas expressed still prove to be extremely relevant and true. Thoreau mentions that many people live unhappy lives, being too preoccupied with labor and expenses. The key to finding the true meaning of life and happiness, he states, is to stop feeding into materialism.
   <br><br>
I think this book is extremely relevant to this course because the climate crisis is fueled by people's materialistic, self-interested values. In regards to food, people buy imported items and eat things that take so many resources to make. Walden writes about not drinking tea or coffee because of the labor used to import them. This also relates to my decision to eat a plant-based diet. By doing this, I am drastically reducing my carbon footprint. In terms of shelter, Thoreau lives in a cabin the size of a garden shed. This reiterates the idea that people do not have to live in luxurious mansions with grand heating systems, and unnecessary functions. Similarly, my family tends to keep only a few items in the house. By living in small, uncrowded homes, people are able to aid the climate crisis. When it comes to clothing, Thoreau mentions having practical and simple attire. He also did not support age fashion industry. I find this very interesting because even though this book was written over 100 years ago, this is still relevant. The clothing industry is a major role player in the climate crisis, therefore by not supporting it, you are helping create a better environment. Lastly, Thoreau mentions fuel. I find it interesting how he discusses fuel in a nonconventional way and explains that food produces fuel which in turn keeps our bodies warm. What I like most about his mentality is the way in which Thoreau simplifies everything. He views things for being practical. 
   <br><br>
I think that if people would have this perspective, they would be less obsessed with material items and showing off their wealth. It's really hard to tell a large body of people to do something like this, although it would really help the climate crisis. I think though that by spreading awareness and being creative, a good number of people could adopt this mentality. I sure hope that happens because it would be a step in the right direction in terms of the climate crisis.

Walden preaches many ideals in which to live a fulfilling and happy life: we should deter from the consumer and materialistic world and live a simplistic life. I agree with you in this sense that Walden is trying to give society alternative options into how to live a better lifestyle and stray away from factors that are not necessary as products that don’t involve food, shelter, clothing, and fuel. The values of how we should live are still prevalent as you mentioned even if it was written in 1854.

   <br><br>

However, what throws me off about Walden’s teachings, are how extremist they are. Walden’s ideas are so extreme that he couldn't even follow what he was saying. Living in the woods away from societal pressures is not an answer and not a sustainable way to live. Thoreau even ends his journey early, from five years to two years, at Walden pond to go back to society and even when he was living in the woods, he still went back to his home area for products. No one can live completely alone without help or with no consumerism.

   <br><br>

It is difficult to motivate people to take action and appreciate Walden's teachings as noncontradictory when they are so extreme. Of course, we should be making advancements in straying away from purchasing fossil fuel and living in large empty houses; but, are we going to all live in a small wooden cottage with four pieces of furniture? No. The reality is, that the majority of the world thinks in a one-sided materialistic way. As Ken stated, people just follow in the steps of their elders for the path they are supposed to follow and what luxuries they are supposed to receive. I would love to live in an idealistic world where people would be willing to make these changes. Thoreau's extreme values may inevitably scare people off from changing at all.
